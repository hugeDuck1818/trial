most spirited courtesan of the time and her presence had been greatly
missed.

Ninon’s followers quickly discovered, however, that she had changed
her old way of doing things, and had set up a new system of options. The
dukes, seigneurs, and princes who wanted to pay for her services could
continue to do so, but they were no longer in control-—she would sleep
with them when she wanted, according to her whim. All their money
bought them was a possibility. If it was her pleasure to sleep with them only
once a month, so be it.

Those who did not want to be what Ninon called a payeur could join
the large and growing group of men she called her martyrs--men who vis—
ited her apartment principally for her friendship, her biting wit, her lute-
playing, and the company of the most vibrant minds of the period,
including Moliere, La Rochefoucauld, and Saint~Evremond. The martyrs,
too, however, entertained a possibility: She would regularly select from
them a fiwori, a man who would become her lover without having to pay,
and to whom she would abandon herself completely for as long as she so
desired-—«a week, a few months, rarely longer. A payeur could not become a
favori, but a martyr had no guarantee of becoming one, and indeed could
remain disappointed for an entire lifetime. The poet Charleval, for examv
pie, never enjoyed Ninon’s favors, but never stopped coming to visit--he
did not want to do without her company.

As word of this system reached polite French society, Ninon became
the object of intense hostility. Her reversal of the position of the courtesan
scandalized the queen mother and her court. Much to their horror, how-
ever, it did not discourage her male suitors—indeed it only increased their
numbers and intensified their desire, It became an honor to be a payeur,
helping Ninon to maintain her lifestyle and her glittering salon, accompa-
nying her sometimes to the theater, and sleeping with her when she chose.
Even more distinguished were the martyrs, enjoying her company without
paying for it and maintaining the hope, however remote, of some day be-
coming her fizvorz‘. That possibility spurred on many a young nobleman, as
word spread that none among the courtesans could surpass Ninon in the
art of love. And so the married and the single, the old and the young, en-
tered her web and chose one of the two options presented to them, both of
which amply satisfied her.

Interpretation
The life of the courtesan entailed the possibility of a power that was denied
a married woman, but it also had obvious perils. The man who paid for the
courtesaxfs services in essence owned her, determining when he could pos-
sess her and when, later on, he would abandon her. As she grew older, her
options narrowed, as fewer men chose her. To avoid a life of poverty she
had to amass her fortune while she was young. The courtesan’s legendary
greed, then, reflected a practical necessity, yet also lessened her allure,
since the illusion of being desired is important to men, who are often alien-

ated if their partner is too interested in their money. As the courtesan aged,
then, she faced a most difficult fate.

Ninon de Lenclos had a horror of any kind of dependence. She early
on tasted a kind of equality with her lovers, and she would not settle into a
system that left her such distasteful options. Strangely enough, the system
she devised in its place seemed to satisfy her suitors as much as it did her.
The payeur: may have had to pay, but the fact that Ninon would only sleep
with them when she wanted to gave them a thrill unavailable with every
other courtesan: She was yielding out of her own desire. The martyrs’
avoidance of the taint of having to pay gave them a sense of superiority; as
members of Ninon’s fraternity of admirers, they also might some day expe
rience the ultimate pleasure of being her favari. Finally, Ninon did not
force her suitors into either category. They could “choose” which side they
prefer:-ed—a freedom flint left them a vestige of masculine pride.

Such is the power of giving people a choice, or rather the illusion of
one, for they are playing with cards you have dealt them. Where the alter-
natives set up by Ivan the Terrible involved a certain risk—-one option
would have led to his losing his power——Ninon created a. situation in which
every option redounded to her favor. From the payeurs she received the
money she needed to run her salon. And from the martyrs she gained the
ultimate in power: She could surround herself with a. bevy of admirers, a
harem from which to choose her lovers.

The system, though, depended on one critical factor: the possibility,
however remote, that a martyr could become a fawn&quot;. The illusion that
riches, glory, or sensual satisfaction may someday fall into your victim&#x27;s lap
is an irresistible carrot to include in your list of choices. That hope, how-
ever slim, will make men accept the most ridiculous situations, because it
leaves them the allimportant option of a dream. The illusion of choice,
married to the possibility of future good fortune, will lure the most stub
born sucker into your glittering web.

KEYS TO POWER
Words like “freedom,” “options,” and “choice” evoke a power of possibility
far beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When examined closely,
the choices we have——in the marketplace, in elections, in our jobs»-tend to
have noticeable limitations: They are often a matter of a choice simply be-
tween A and B, with the rest of the alphabet out of the picture. Yet as long
as the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the missing
options. We “choose” to believe that the game is fair, and that we have our
freedom. We prefer not to think too much about the depth of our liberty to
choose.

This unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices stems from
the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of amdety. The phrase “un-
limited options” sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited options would
actually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Our limited range of
choices comforts us.

258

LAW 31

This supplies the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities for
deception. For people who are choosing between alternatives find it hard
to believe they are being manipulated or deceived; they cannot see that
you are allowing them a small amount of free will in exchange for a much
more powerful imposition of your own will. Setting up a narrow range of
choices, then, should always be a part of your deceptions. There is a say-
ing: If you can get the bird to walk into the cage on its own, it will sing that
much more prettily.

The following are among the most common forms of “controlling the

options”:

Color the Choices. This was a favored technique of Henry Kissinger. As
President Richard Nixon’s secretary of state, Kissinger considered himself
better informed than his boss, and believed that in most situations he could
make the best decision on his own. But if he tried to determine policy, he
would offend or perhaps enrage a notoriously insecure man. So Kissinger
would propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and would
present them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the
best solution compared to the others. Time afler time, Nixon fell for the
bait, never suspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed him.
This is an excellent device to use on the insecure master.

Force the Resistor. One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton H. Er-
ickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the relapse. His pa»
tients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their apparent susceptibility
to the therapy masked a deep resistance: They would soon relapse into old
habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming to see him. To avoid this, Ericlo
son began ordering some patients to have a relapse, to make themselves feel
as bad as when they first came in—-——to go back to square one. Faced with
this option, the patients would usually “choose” to avoid the relapse-
which, of course, was what Erickson really wanted.

This is a good technique to use on children and other willful people
who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to
“choose” what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.

Alter the Playing Field. In the 1860s,john D. Rockefeller set out to cre-
ate an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil companies they
would figure out what he was doing and fight back. Instead, he began se-
cretly buying up the railway companies that transported the oil. When he
then attempted to take over a particular company, and met with resistance,
he reminded them of their dependence on the rails. Refusing them ship-
ping, or simply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller a.l~
tered the playing field so that the only options the small oil producers had
were the ones he gave them.

In this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it
doesn’t matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at all
costs.

LAW 31

259

The Shrinking Options. The latemineteenth-century art dealer Am-
broise Vollard perfected this technique.

Customers would come to Volla.rd’s shop to see some Cézannes. He
would show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend to
doze off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They would
usually come back the next day to see the paintings again, but this time
Vollard would pull out less interesting works, pretending he thought they
were the same ones. The baffled customers would look at the new offer-
ings, leave to think them over, and return yet again. Once again the same
thing would happen: Vollard would show paintings of lesser quality still. Fi-
nally the buyers would realize they had better grab what he was showing
them, because tomorrow they would have to settle for something worse,
perhaps at even higher prices.

A variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the buyer
hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent negotiating ploy to
use on the chronically indecisive, who will fall for the idea that they are get-
ting a better deal today than if they wait till tomorrow.

The Weak Man on the Precipice. The weak are the easiest to maneuver
by controlling their options. Cardinal do Retz, the great seventeenth~cen-
tury provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to the Duke of Orléans,
who was notoriously indecisive. It was a constant struggle to convince the
duke to take action»-—-he would hem and haw, weigh the options, and wait
till the last moment, giving everyone around him an ulcer. But Retz discov~
ered a way to handle him: He would describe all sorts of dangers, exaggep
ating them as much as possible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in
every direction except one: the one Retz was pushing him to take.

This tactic is similar to “Color the Choices,” but with the weak you
have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotions—use fear and terror
to propel them into action. Tn: reason and they will always find a way to
procrastinate.

Brothers in Crime. This is a classic convartist technique: You attract your
victims to some criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood and guilt be-
tween you. They participate in your deception, commit a crime (or think
they do-—-see the story of Sam Geezil in Law 3), and are easily manipu-
lated. Serge Stavisky, the great French con artist of the 1920s, so entangled
the government in his scams and swindles that the state did not dare to
prosecute him, and “chose” to leave him alone. It is often wise to implicate
in your deceptions the very person who can do you the most harm if you
fail. Their involvement can be subtle—-even a hint of their involvement
will narrow their options and buy their silence.

The Horns of a Dilemma. This idea was demonstrated by General
William Sherma.n’s infamous march through Georgia during the American
Civil War. Although the Confederates knew what direction Sherman was

2&amp;0

LAW’ 31

heading in, they never knew if he would attack from the left or the right, for
he divided his army into two wings--and if the rebels retreated from one
wing they found themselves facing the other. This is a classic trial lawyer’s
technique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to decide between two possible
explanations of an event, both of which poke a hole in their story. They
have to answer the lawyer’s questions, but whatever they say they hurt
themselves. The key to this move is to strike quickly: Deny the victim the
time to think of an escape. As they wriggle between the horns of the
dilemma, they dig their own grave.

Understand: In your struggles with your rivals, it will often be necessary
for you to hurt them. And if you are clearly the agent of their punishment,
expect a counterat1ack——expect revenge. If, however, they seem to them-
selaes to be the agents of their own misfortune, they will submit quietly.
When Ivan left Moscow for his rural village, the citizens asking him to re-
turn agreed to his demand for absolute power. Over the years to come,
they resented him less for the terror he unleashed on the country, because,
alter all, they had granted him his power themselves. This is why it is al
ways good to allow your victims their choice of poison, and to cloak your
involvement in providing it to them as far as possible.

REVERSAI.
Controlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise yourself as the
agent of power and punishment. The tactic works best, then, for those
whose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too openly without incur-
ring suspicion, resentment, and anger. Even as a general rule, however, it is
rarely wise to be seen as exerting power directly and forcefully, no matter
how secure or strong you are. It is usually more elegant and more effective
to give people the illusion of choice.

On the other hand, by limiting other people’s options you sometimes
limit your own. There are situations in which it is to your advantage to
allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate,
you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather information, and plan
your deceptions. The nineteenth~century banker James Rothschild liked
this method: He felt that if he tried to control his opponents’ movements,
he lost the chance to observe their strategy and plan a more effective
course. The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the more
forcefully he could act against them in the long run.

OBSERVANCI:‘. OF THE LAW
The cityvstate of Venice was prosperous for so long that its citizens felt their
small republic had destiny on its side. In the Middle Ages and High Re
naissance, its virtual monopoly on trade to the east made it the wealthiest
city in Europe. Under a beneficent republican government, Venelians en-
joyed liberties that few other Italians had ever known. Yet in the sixteenth
century their fortunes suddenly changed, The opening of the New World
transferred power to the Atlantic side of Europewto the Spanish and For-
tuguese, and later the Dutch and English. Venice could not compete eco
nomically and its empire gradually dwindled. The final blow was the
devastating loss of a prized Mediterranean possession,
the island of
Cyprus, captured from Venice by the Turks in 1570.

Now noble families went broke in Venice, and banks began to fold. A
kind of gloom and depression settled over the citizens. They had known a
glittering past~—-had either lived through it or heard stories about it from
their elders. The closeness of the glory years was humiliating. The Vene—
clans half believed that the goddess Fortune was only playing a joke on
them, and that the old days would soon return. For the time being, though,
what could they do?

In 1589 rumors began to swirl around Venice of the a.m‘val not far
away of a mysterious man called “ll Bragadino,&quot; a master of alchemy, a
man who had won incredible wealth through his ability, it was said, to mul-
tiply gold through the use of a secret substance. The rumor spread quickly
because a few years earlier, a Venetian nobleman passing through Poland
had heard a learned man prophesy that Venice would recover her past
glory and power if she could find a man who understood the alchemic art
of manufacturing gold. And so, as word reached Venice of the gold this
Bragadino possessed——he clinked gold coins continuously in his hands,
and golden objects filled his palace-some began to dream: Through him,
their city would prosper again.

Members of Venice’s most important noble families accordingly went
together to Brescia, where Bragadino lived. They toured his palace and
watched in awe as he demonstrated his gold-making abilities,
taking a
pinch of seemingly worthless minerals and transforming it into several
ounces of gold dust. The Venetian senate prepared to debate the idea of ex
tending an ofllcial invitation to Bragadino to stay in Venice at the city’s ex-
pense, when word suddenly reached them that they were competing with
the Duke of Mantua for his services. They heard of a magnificent party in
Bragadinds palace for the duke, featuring garments with golden buttons,
gold watches, gold plates, and on and on. Worried they might lose Bra-
gaclino (0 Martina, the senate voted almost unanimously to invite him to
Venice, promising him the mountain of money he would need to continue
living in his luxurious style-~but only if he came right away.

Late that year the mysterious Bragaclino arrived in Venice. With his
piercing dark eyes under thick brows, and the two enormous black mastiffs
that accompanied him everywhere, he was forbidding and impressive. He
took up residence in a sumptuous palace on the island of the Giudecca,

other whims. A kind of alchemy fever spread through Venice. On street
corners, hawkers would sell coal, distilling apparatus, bellows, how—to
books on the subject. Everyone began to practice alchemyw-everyone ex—
cept Bragadino.

The alchemist seemed to be in no hurry to begin manufacturing the
gold that would save Venice from ruin. Strangely enough this only in-
creased his popularity and following; people thronged from all over Eu-
rope, even Asia, to meet this remarkable man. Months went by, with gifts
pouring in to Bragadino from all sides. Still he gave no sign of the miracle
that the Venetians confidently expected him to produce. Eventually the cit-
izens began to grow impatient, wondering if he would wait forever. At first
the senators warned them not to hurry him-—-he was a capricious devil,
who needed to be cajoled. Finally, though, the nobility began to wonder
too, and the senate came under pressure to show a return on the city’s ba.l~
looning investment.

Bragadino had only scorn for the doubters, but he responded to them.
He had, he said, already deposited in the city’s mint the mysterious sub-
stance with which he multiplied gold. He could use this substance up all at
once, and produce double the gold, but the more slowly the process took
place, the more it would yield. If left alone for seven years, sealed in a cas
ket, the substance would multiply the gold in the mint thirty times over.
Most of the senators agreed to wait to reap the gold mine Bragadino
promised. Others, however, were angry: seven more years of this man liv-
ing royally at the public trough! And many of the common citizens of
Venice echoed these sentiments. Finally the alchemist‘s enemies demanded
he produce a proof of his skills: a substantial amount of gold, and soon.

Lofty, apparently devoted to his art, Bragadino responded that Venice,
in its impatience, had betrayed him, and would therefore lose his services.
He left town, going first to nearby Padua, then, in 1590, to Munich, at the
invitation of the Duke of Bavaria, who, like the entire city of Venice, had
known great wealth but had fallen into bankruptcy through his own profli-
gacy, and hoped to regain his fortune through the famous alchemist’s ser-
vices. And so Bragadino resumed the comfortable arrangement he had
known in Venice, and the same pattern repeated itself.

Interpretation
The young Cypriot Mamugna had lived in Venice for several years before
reincamating himself as the alchemist Bragadino. He saw how gloom had
settled on the city, how everyone was hoping for a redemption from some
indefinite source. While other charlatans mastered everyday cons based on
sleight of hand, Mamugna mastered human nature. With Venice as his tar-
get from the start, he traveled abroad, made some money through his
alchemy scams, and then returned to Italy, setting up shop in Brescia.
There he created a reputation that he knew would spread to Venice. From
a distance, in fact, his aura of power would be all the more impressive.

pic of his alchemic skill. His sumptuous palace, his opulent garments, the
clink of gold in his hands, all these provided a superior argument to any-
thing rational. And these established the cycle that kept him going: His ob~
vious wealth confirmed his reputation as an alchemist, so that patrons like
the Duke of Mantua gave him money, which allowed him to live in wealth,
which reinforced his reputation as an alchemist, and so on. Only once this
reputation was established, and dukes and senators were fighting over him,
did he resort to the trifling necessity of a demonstration. By then, however,
people were easy to deceive: They wanted to believe. The Venetian sena-
tors who watched him multiply gold wanted to believe so badly that they
failed to notice the glass pipe up his sleeve, from which he slipped gold
dust into his pinches of minerals. Brilliant and capricious, he was the al
chemist of their fantasies—-and once he had created an aura like this, no
one noticed his simple deceptions.

Such is the power of the fantasies that take root in us, especially in
times of scarcity and decline. People rarely believe that their problems
arise from their own misdeeds and stupidity. Someone or something out
there is to blame—-the other, the world, the gods—and so salvation comes
from the outside as well. Had Bragadino arrived in Venice armed with a
detailed analysis of the reasons behind the city’s economic decline, and of
the hardcnosed steps that it could take to turn things around, he would
have been scorned. The reality was too ugly and the solution too painful-—
mostly the kind of hard work that the citizens‘ ancestors had mustered to
create an empire. Fantasy, on the other hand——in this case the romance of
alchemy--was easy to understand and infinitely more palatable.

To gain power, you must be a source of pleasure for those around
you--and pleasure comes from playing to people’s fantasies. Never
promise a gradual improvement through hard work; rather, promise the
moon, the great and sudden transformation, the pot of gold.

KEYS TO POWER
Fantasy can never operate alone. It requires the backdrop of the huxndrum
and the mundane. It is the oppressiveness of reality that allows fantasy to
take root and bloom. In sixteenth-century Venice, the reality was one of de
clirre and loss of prestige. The corresponding fantasy described a sudden
recovery of past glories through the miracle of alchemy. While the reality
only got worse, the Venetians inhabited a happy dream world in which
their city restored its fabulous wealth and power overnight, turning dust
into gold.

The person who can spin a fantasy out of an oppressive reality has ac-
cess to untold power. As you search for the fantasy that will take hold of the

masses, then, keep your eye on the banal truths that weigh heavily on us
all. Never be distracted by peop1e’s glamorous portraits of themselves and
their lives; search and dig for what really imprisons them. Once you find
that, you have the magical key that will put great power in your hands.

Although times and people change, let us examine a few of the oppres~

sive realities that endure, and the opportunities for power they provide:

The Reality: Change isslow andgradual. It requires ham’ work, a bit ofluck, afair
amount ofrel —sacrg&#x27;fice, and a lot pfpatience.
The Fantasy: A sudden tmmfarmation will bring a total change in aneivfiirtunes,
bypassing work, luck, self-sacrifice, and time in onefantastic make.

This is of course the fantasy par excellence of the charlatans who
prowl among us to this day, and was the key to B1&#x27;agadin0’s success.
Promise a great and total change-—~from poor to rich, sickness to health,
misery to ecstasy—and you will have followers.

How did the great sixteenth-century German quack Leonhard
Thumeisser become the court physician for the Elector of Brandenburg
without ever studying medicine? Instead of offering amputations, leeches,
and foul~tasting purgatives (the medicaments of the time), Thurneisser ofv
fared sweevtasting elixirs and promised instant recovery. Fashionable
courtiers especially wanted his solution of “drinkable gold,” which cost a
fortune. If some inexplicable illness assailed you, Thur-neisser would con-
sult a horoscope and prescribe a talisman. Who could resist such a
fantasy-—-health and well-being without sacrifice and pain!

The Reality: The social realm has lzard~set codes and boundaries. We understand
time limits and know that we have to move within the samefamiliar circles, ziay in
and ritzy out.

ofadventure.

In the early 1700s, all London was abuzz with talk of a mysterious
stranger, a young man named George Psalmanazar. He had arrived from
what was to most Englishmen a fantastical
land: the island of Formosa
(now Taiwan), off
the coast of China. Oxford University engaged
Psalmauazar to teach the island’s language; a few years later he translated
the Bible into Formosan, then wrote a bool&lt;—ar: immediate bestseller--on
Formosa’s history and geography. English royalty wined and dined the
young man, and everywhere he went he entertained his hosts with won-
drous stories of his homeland, and its bizarre customs.

After Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed that he was in fact
merely a Frenchman with a rich imagination. Everything he had said about
Formosa——-its alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire culture-—he had
invented. He had built on the English puhlic’s ignorance of the place to
concoct an elaborate story that fulfilled their desire for the exotic and

strange. British cultu.re’s rigid control of people’s dangerous dreams gave
him the perfect opportunity to exploit their fantasy.

I

The fantasy of the exotic, of course, can also skirt the sexual. It must
not come too close, though, for tl1e physical hinders the power of fantasy; it
can be seen, grasped, and then tired of-—the fate of most courtesans. The
bodily charms of the mistress only whet the master’s appetite for more and
different pleasures, a new beauty to adore. To bring power, fantasy must re»
main to some degree unrealized, literally unreal. The dancer Mata Hari,
for instance, who rose to public prominence in Paris before World War I,
had quite ordinary looks. Her power came from the fantasy she created of
being strange ‘and exotic, unknowable and indecipherable. The taboo she
worked with was less sex itself than the breaking of social codes.

Another form of the fantasy of the exotic is simply the hope for relief
from boredom. Con artists love to play on the oppressiveness of the work-
ing world, its lack of adventure. Their cons might involve, say, the recov-
ery of lost Spanish treasure, with the possible participation of an alluring
Mexican sefiorita. and a connection to the president of a South American
country—a.nything oficering release from the humdrum.

The Reality: Society isfragmented andfull ofconflict.
The Fantasy: People can come together in a mystical union ofsouls.

In the 19205 the con man Oscar Hartzell made a quick fortune out of
the agevold Sir Francis Drake swindle—basically promising any sucker who
happened to be surnamed “Drake” a substantial share of the long-lost
“Drake treasure,” to which Hartzell had access. Thousands across the Mid-
west fell for the scam, which Hartzell cleverly turned into a crusade against
the government and everyone else who was trying to keep the Drake for»
tune out of the rightful hands of its heirs. There developed a mystical union
of the oppressed Drakes, with emotional rallies and meetings. Promise such
a union and you can gain much power, but it is a dangerous power that can
easily turn against you. This is a fantasy for demagogues to play on.

The Reality: Death. The dead cannot be brought back, tlzepart cannot be changed.
The Fantasy.‘ A sudden reversal aftlzis intolerablefact.

This con has many variations, but requires great skill and subtlety.
The beauty and importance of the art of Vermeer have long been rec
ognized, but his paintings are small in number, and are extremely rare. In
the 1930s, though, Vermeers began to appear on the art market. Experts
were called on to verify them, and pronounced them real. Possession of
these new Vermeers would crown a collector’s career. It was like the resur-
rection of Lazarus: In a strange way, Vermeer had been brought back to
life. The past had been changed.

Only later did it come out that the new Vermeers were the work of a
middle-aged Dutch forget named Han van Meegeren. And he had chosen

268

LAW 32

Vermeer for his scam because he understood fantasy: The paintings would
seem real precisely because the public, and the experts as well, so desper-
ately wanted to believe they were.

Remember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure and
promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering, xhen,
should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar; it is the
mirage in the distance, withdrawing as the sucker approaches. Never be
(no direct in describing the fantasywkeep it vague. As a forget of fantasies,
let your victim come close enough to see and be tempted, but keep him far
away enough that he stays dreaming and desiring.

REVERSAL
If there is power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses, there is also
danger, Fantasy usually contains an element of play-the public half real-
izes it is being duped, but it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing the en»
tertainment and the temporary diversion from the everyday that you are
providing. So keep it 1ight~—never come too close to the place where you
are actually expected to produce results. That place may prove extremely
hazardous.

After Bragadino established himself in Munich, he found that the
sober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy than the tempera-
mental Venelians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he needed it des—
perately to rescue him from the hopeless mess he was in. As Bragadino
played his familiar waiting game, accepting gifts and expecting patience,
the public grew angry. Money was being spent and was yielding no results.
In 1592 the Bavarians demanded justice, and eventually Bragadino found
himself swinging from the gallows. As before, he had promised and had
not delivered, but this time he had misjudged the forbearance of his hosts,
and his inability to fulfill their fantasy proved fatal.

One last thing: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is al»
ways fantastical. It certainly contrasts with reality, but reality itself is some
times so theatrical and stylized that fantasy becomes a desire for simple
things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of himself, for example, as a
homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the common man’s
president.

P. T. Barnum created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwarf who
dressed up as famous leaders of the past, such as Napoleon, and iam-
pooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to Queen
Victoria, by appealing to the fantasy of the time: Enough of the vain-
glorious rulers of history, the common man knows best Tom Thumb re-
versed the familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange and unknown
becomes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law, for underlying it
was the fantasy that the simple man is without problems, and is happier
than the powerful and the rich.

Both Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully
maintained their distance. Should you play with such a fantasy, you too
must carefully cultivate distance and not allow your “common” persona to
become too familiar or it will not project as fantasy.

DISCOVER EACH

MAN’S THUMBSCREW

jUDGMENT
Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That
weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable
emotion or need; it can also be a small seem! pleasure.
Either way, oncefound, it is a thumbscrew you can mm
to your advantage.

‘ 271

FINDING THE THUMBSCREW: A Strategic Plan of Action
We all have resistances. We live with a perpetual armor around ourselves
to defend against change and the intrusive actions of friends and rivals. We
would like nothing more than to be lefi to do things our own way. Con-
stantly butting up against these resistances will cost you a lot of energy.
One of the most important things to realize about people, though, is that
they all have a weakness, some part. of their psychological armor that will
not resist, that will bend to your will if you find it and push on it. Some pee»
ple wear their weaknesses openly, others disguise them. Those who dis
guise them are often the ones most effectively undone through that one
chink in their armor.

In planning your assault, keep these principles in mind:

Pay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious Signals. As Sigmund
Freud remarked, “No mortal can keep at secret. If his lips are silent, he chat-
ters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.” This is a
critical concept in the search for a person’s weakness-—it is revealed by
seemingly unimportant gestures and passing words.

The key is not only what you look for but where and how you look.
Everyday conversaiion supplies the richest mine of weaknesses, so train
yourself to listen. Start by always seeming interested——~the appearance of a
sympathetic ear will spur anyone to talk. A clever trick, often used by the
nineteenth-century French statesman Talleyrand, is to appear to open up to
the other person, to share a secret with them. It can be completely made
up, or it can be real but of no great importance to you——-the important
thing is that it should seem to come from the heart. This will usually elicit at
response that is not only as frank as yours but more genuine»-a response
that reveals a weakness.

If you suspect that someone has a. particular soft spot, probe for it indi»
rectly. If, for instance, you sense that a man has a need to be loved, openly
flatter him. If he laps up your compliments, no matter how obvious, you
are on the right track. Train your eye for details——how someone tips a
waiter, what delights a person, the hidden messages in clothes. Find peo-
ple-.’s idols, the things they worship and will do anything to get“-perhaps
you can be the supplier of their fantasies. Remember: Since we all my to
hide our weaknesses, there is little to be leamed from our conscious behav-
ior. What oozes out in the little things outside our conscious control is what
you want to know.

Find the Helpless Child. Most weaknesses begin in childhood, before
the self builds up compensatory defenses. Perhaps the child was pampered
or indulged in a particular area, or perhaps a certain emotional need went
unfulfilled; as he or she grows older, the indulgence or the deficiency may
be buried but never disappears. Knowing about a childhood need gives
you a powerful key to a person’s weakness.

One sign of this weakness is that when you touch on it the person will
often act like a child. Be on the lookout, then, for any behavior that should

portant, such as parental support, when they were children, supply it, or its
facsimile. If they reveal a secret taste, a hidden indulgence, indulge it. In ei-
ther case they will be unable to resist you.

Look for Contrasts. An overt trait often conceals its opposite. People
who thump their chests are often big cowards; a prudish exterior may hide
a lascivious soul; the uptight are often screaming for adventure; the shy are
dying for attention. By probing beyond appearances, you will often find
people’s weaknesses in the opposite of the qualities they reveal to you.

Find the Weak Link. Sometimes in your search for weaknesses it is not
what but who that matters. In today’s versions of the court, there is often
someone behind the scenes who has a great deal of power, a tremendous
influence over the person superficially on top. These behind-tliescenes
powerbrokers are the group’s weak link: Win their favor and you indirectly
influence the king. Alternatively, even in a group of people acting with the
appearance of one will—as when a group under attack closes ranks to resist
an outsi-:ler———there is always a weak link in the chain. Find the one person
who will bend under pressure.

Fill the Void. The two main emotional voids to Kill are insecurity and um
happiness. The insecure are suckers for any kind of social validation; as for
the chronically unhappy, look for the roots of their unhappiness. The inse
cure and the unhappy are the people least able to disguise their weak-
nesses. The ability to fill their emotional voids is a great source of power,
and an indefinitely prolongable one.

Feed on Uncontrollable Emotions. The uncontrollable emotion can be
a paranoid fear-wa fear disproportionate to the situaIion~—-or any base mo-
tive such as lust, greed, vanity, or hatred. People in the grip of these emo-
tions often cannot control themselves, and you can do the controlling for
them.

Louis, as the regent ruling France until her son reached his majority. Every-
one expected Richelieu to say the usual kind words to the young king. In
stead, however, he looked directly at and only at the queen mofher. indeed
his speech ended in long and fulsome praise of her, praise so glowing that it
actually offended some in the Church. But the smile on the queen’s face as
she lapped up Richelielfs compliments was unforgettable.

A year later the queen mother appointed Richelieu secretary of state
for foreign affairs, an incredible coup for the young bishop. He had now
entered the inner circle of power, and he studied the workings of the court
as if it were the machinery of a watch. An Italian, Concino Concini, was
the queen mother’s favorite, or rather her lover, a role that made him per-
haps the most powerful man in France. Concini was vain and foppish, and
Richelieu played him perfectly—-attending to him as if he were the king.
Within months Richelieu had become one of Concim&quot;s favorites. But
something happened in 1617 that turned everything upside down:
the
young king, who up until then had shown every sign of being an idiot, had
Concini murdered and his most important associates imprisoned. In so
doing Louis took command of the country with one blow, sweeping the
queen mother aside.

Had Richelieu played it wrong? He had been close to both Concini
and Marie de Médicis whose advisers and ministers were now all out of
favor, some even arrested. The queen mother herself was shut up in the
Louvre, a virtual prisoner. Richelieu wasted no time. If everyone was de-
serfing Marie de Médicis, he would stand by her. He knew Louis could not
get rid of her, for the king was still very young, and had in any case always
been inordinately attached to her. As Man&#x27;e’s only remaining powerful
friend, Richelieu filled the valuable function of liaison between the king
and his mother. In return he received her protection, and was able to sur—
vive the palace coup, even to thrive. Over the next few years the queen
mother grew still more dependent on him, and in 1622 she repaid him for
his loyalty: Through the intercession of her allies in Rome, Richelieu was
elevated to the powerful rank of cardinal.

By 1623 King Louis was in trouble. He had no one he could trust to
advise him, and although he was now a young man instead of a boy, he re
mained childish in spirit, and affairs of state came hard to him. Now that he
had taken the throne, Marie was no longer the regent and theoretically had
no power, but she still had her son’s ear. and she kept telling him that
Richelieu was his only possible savior. At first Louis would have none of
it——-he hated the cardinal with a passion, only tolerating him out of love for
Marie. In the end, however, isolated in the court and crippled by his own
iudecisiveness, he yielded to his mother and made Richelieu fixst his chief
Councilor and later prime minister.

Now Richelieu no longer needed Marie de Médicis. He stopped visit-
ing and courting her, stopped listening to her opinions, even argued with
her and opposed her wishes. Instead be concentrated on the king, making
himself indispensable to his new master. All the previous premiers, under
standing the king’s childishness, had tried to keep him out of trouble; the

shrewd Richelieu played him differently, deliberately pushing him into
one ambitious project after another, such as a crusade against
the
Huguenots and finally an extended war with Spain. The immensity of
these projects only made the king more dependent on his powerful pre-
mier, the only man able to keep order in the realm. And so, for the next
eighteen years, Richelieu, exploiting the king’s weaknesses, governed and
molded France according to his own vision, unifying the country and mak-
ing it a strong European power for centuries to come.
lntcipretation
Richelieu saw everything as a military campaign, and no strategic move
was more important to him than discovering his enemy’s weaknesses and
applying pressure to them. As early as his speeoh in 1615, he was looking
for the weak link in the chain of power, and he saw that it was the queen
mother, Not that Marie was obviously weakmslie governed both France
and her son; but Richelieu saw that she was really an insecure woman who
needed constant masculine attention. He showered her with afiection and
respect, even toadying up to her favorite, Concini. He knew the day would
come when the king would take over, but he also recognized that Louis
loved his mother dearly and would always remain a child in relation to her.
The way to control Louis, then, was not by gaining his favor, which could
change overnight, but by gaining sway over his mother, for whom his afv
fection would never change.

Once Richelieu had the position he desiredm-prime minister———he dis-
carded the queen mother, moving on to the next weak link in the chain:
the king‘s own character. There was a part of him that would always be a.
helpless child in need of higher authority. It was on the foundation of the
king’s weakness that Richelieu established his own power and fame.

Remember: When entering the court, find the weak link. The person
in control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind the scenes-«
the favorite, the husband or wife, even the court fool. This person may
have more weaknesses than the king himself, because his power depends
on all kinds of capricious factors outside his control.

Finally, when dealing with helpless children who cannot make deci-
sions, play on their weakness and push them into bold ventures, They will
have to depend on you even more, for you will become the adult figure
whom they rely on to get them out of scrapes and to safety.

head of an engineering company, and entered into conversation with him.
Loller had made his fortune only recently, and forging social connections
was very important to him. He felt honored and somewhat intimidated by
this sophisticated man, who spoke perfect English with a hint of a foreign
accent Over the days to come, the two became friends.

Loller of course did most of the talking, and one night he confessed
that his business was doing poorly, with more troubles ahead. In return,
Lustig confided in his new friend that he too had serious money
prob1ems——Communisls had seized his family estate and all its assets. He
was too old to learn a trade and go to work. Luckily he had found an an
swer——“a money—making machine.&quot; “You counterfeit?” Loller whispered in
half—shock. No, Lusiig replied, explaining that through a secret chemical
process. his machine could duplicate any paper currency with complete ac»
curacy. Put in a dollar bill and six hours laxer you had two, both perfect. He
proceeded to explain how the machine had been smuggled out of Europe,
how the Germans had developed it to undermine the British, how it had
supported the count for several years, and on and on. When Loller insisted
on a demonstration, the two men went to Lustig&#x27;s room, where the count
produced a magnificent mahogany box fitted with slots, cranks, and dials.
Loller watched as Lustig inserted a. dollar bill in the box. Sure enough,
early the following morning Lustig pulled out two bills, still wet from the
chemicals.

Lustig gave the notes to Loller, who immediately took the bills to a
local bank—-——which accepted them as genuine. Now the businessman fever-
ishly begged Lusug to sell him a machine. The count explained that there
was only one in existence, so Loller made him a high offer: $25,000, then a
considerable amount (more than $400,000 in today’s terms). Even so,
Lustig seemed reluctant: He did not feel right about making his friend pay
so much. Yet finally he agreed to the sale. After all, he said, “I suppose it
matters little what you pay me. You are, after all, going to recover the
amount within a few days by duplicating your own bills.” Making Loller
swear never to reveal the machine’s existence to other people, Lustig ac»
cepted the money. Later the same day he checked out of the hotel. A year
later, after many futile attempts at duplicating bills, Loller finally went to
the police with the story of how Count Lustig had conned him with a pair
of dollar bills, some chemicals, and a. worthless mahogany box.
Interpretation
Count Lustlg had an eagle eye for other people’s weaknesses. He saw them
in the smallest gesture. Loller, for instance, overtipped waiters, seemed
nervous in conversation with the concierge, talked loudly about his busi»
ness. His weakness, Lustig knew, was his need for social validation and for
the respect that he thought his wealth had earned him. He was also chroni-
cally insecure. Luslig had come to the hotel to hunt for prey. In Loller he
horned in on the perfect sucker»-—a man hungering for someone to fill his
psychic voids.

In offering Loller his friendship, then, Lustig knew he was offering him
the immediate respect of the other guests. As a count, Lustig was also offer-

ing the newly rich businessman access to the glittering world of old wealth.
And for the coup de grace, he apparently owned a machine that would res-
cue Loller from his worries. It would even put him on a par with Lustig
himself, who had also used the machine to maintain his status. No wonder
Loller took the bait.

Remember: When searching for suckers, always look for the dissatis-
fled, the unhappy, the insecure. Such people are riddled with weaknesses
and have needs that you can fill. Their neediness is the groove in which
you place your thumbnail and turn them at will.

Observance III
In the year 1559, the French king Henri ll died in a jousting exhibition. His
son assumed the throne, becoming Francis 11, but in the background stood
Henri’s wife and queen, Catherine de’ Médjcis, a woman who had long
ago proven her skill in affairs of state. When Francis died the next year,
Catlierine took control of the country as regent to her next son in line of
succession, the future Charles IX, a mere ten years old at the time.

The main threats to the queens power were Antoine de Bourbon, king
of Navarre, and his brother, Louis, the powerful prince of Condé, both of
whom could claim the right to serve as regent instead of Catherine, who,
after all, was Italian——-a foreigner. Catherine quickly appointed Antoine
lieutenant general of the kingdom, a title that seemed to satisfy his ambi-
tion. It also meant that he had to remain in court, where Catherine could
keep an eye on him. Her next move proved smarter still: Antoine had a
notorious weakness for young women, so she assigned one of her most at-
tractive maids of honor, Louise de Rouet, to seduce him. Now Antoine’s
intimate, Louise reported all of his actions to Catherine. The move worked
so brilliantly that Catherine assigned another of her maids to Prince
Condé, and thus was formed her atcadron 2mla1Lt——“lly1&#x27;ng squadron”-—of
young grls whom she used to keep the unsuspecting males in the court
under her control.

In 1572 Catherine married 05 her daughter, Marguerite de Valois, to
Henri, the son of Antoine and the new king of Navarre. To put a family that
had always struggled against her so close to power was a dangerous move,
so to make sure of Henri’s loyalty she unleashed on him the loveliest mem-
ber of her “flying squadron,” Charlotte de Beaune Semblancay, baroness
of Sauves. Catherine did this even though Henri was married to her daugh-
ter. Within weeks, Marguerite de Valois wrote in her memoirs, “Mme. de
Sauves so completely ensnared my husband that we no longer slept to-
gether, nor even conversed.”

The baroness was an excellent spy and helped to keep Henri under
Cathei-ine’s thumb. W’hen the queen’s youngest son, the Duke of Alencon,
grew so close to Henri that she feared the two might plot against her, she
assigned the baroness to him as well. This most infamous member of the
flying squadron quickly seduced Alengon, and soon the two young men
fought over her and their friendship quickly ended, along with any danger
of a conspiracy.

Interpretation
Catherine had seen very early on the sway that a mistress has over a man
of power: Her own husband, Henri II, had kept one of the most infamous
mistresses of them all, Diane de Poitiers. What Catherine learned from the
experience was that a man like her husband wanted to feel he could win a
woman over without having to rely on his status, which he had inherited
rather than earned. And such a need contained a huge blind spot: As long
as the woman began the affair by acting as if she had been conquered, the
man would fail to notice that as dine passed the mistress had come to hold
power over him, as Diane de Poitiers did over Henri. It was Catherine’s
strategy to turn this weakness to her advantage, using it as a way to conquer
and control men. All she had to do was unleash the loveliest women in the
court, her “flying squadron,” on men whom she knew shared her hus«
ba.nd’s vulnerability.

Remember. Always look for passions and obsessions that cannot be
controlled. The stronger the passion, the more vulnerable the person. This
may seem surprising, for passionate people look strong. In fact, however,
they are simply filling the stage with their theatricality, distracting people
from how weak and helpless they really are. A man’s need to conquer
women actually reveals a tremendous helplessness that has made suckers
out of them for thousands of years. Look at the part of a person that is most
visible—their greed, their lust, their intense fear. These are the emotions
they cannot conceal, and over which they have the least control. And what
people cannot control, you can control for them.

Observance IV
Arabella Huntington, wife of the great late-nineteenth-century railroad
magnate Collis P. Huntington, came from humble origins and always
struggled for social recognition among her wealthy peers. When she gave a
party in her San Francisco mansion, few of the social elite would show up;
most of them took her for a gold digger, not their kind. Because of her hus-
band’s fabulous wealth, art dealers courted her, but with such condescen-
sion they obviously saw her as an upstart. Only one man of consequence
treated her difl’erently: the dealer Joseph Duveen.

For the first few years of Duveen’s relationship with Arabella, he made
no eifort to sell expensive art to her. Instead he accompanied her to fine
stores, chatted endlessly about queens and princesses he knew, on and on.
At last, she thought, a man who treated her as an equal, even a superior, in
high society. Meanwhile, if Duveen did not try to sell art to her, he did sub-
tly educate her in his aesthetic ideas——n-amely, that the best at was the
most expensive art. And after Arabella had soaked up his way of seeing
things, Duveen would act as if she always had exquisite taste, even though
before she met him her aesthetics had been abysmal.

When Collis Huntington died, in 1900, Arabella came into a fortune.
She suddenly started to buy expensive paintings, by Rembrandt and
Velazquez, for exa.rnple—and only from Duveen. Years later Duveen sold
her Gainsb0rough’s Blue Boy for the highest price ever paid for a work of

shown little interest in collecting.
Interpretation
joseph Duveen instantly understood Arabella Huntington and what made
her tick: She wanted to feel important, at home in society. lntensely inse-
cure about her lowerclass background, she needed confirmation of her
new social smtus. Duveen waited. lnstead of rushing into trying to per-
suade her to collect art, he subtly went to work on her weaknesses. He
made her feel that she deserved his attention not because she was the wife
of one of the wealthiest men in the world but because of her own special
character--and this completely melted her. Duveen never condescended
to Arabella; rather than lecturing to her, he instilled his ideas in her indi-
rectly. The result was one of his best and most devoted clients, and also the
sale of The Bhze Bay.

People’s need for validation and recognition, their need to feel impor~
tant, is the best kind of weakness to exploit. First, it is almost universal; sec-
ond, exploiting it is so very easy. All you have to do is find ways to make
people feel better about their taste, their social standing, their intelligence.
Once the fish are hooked, you can reel
them in again and again, for
yea.rs——you are filling a positive role, giving them what they cannot get on
their own. They may never suspect that you are turning them like a thumb«
screw, and if they do they may not care, because you are making them feel
better about themselves, and that is worth any price.

Observance V
In 1862 King William of Prussia named Otto Von Bismarck premier and
minister for foreign affairs. Bismarck was known for his boldness, his a.rnbi~
tion—~and his interest in strengthening the military. Since Wflliam was sur-
rounded by liberals in his ghvemment and cabinet, politicians who already
wanted to limit his powers, it was quite dangerous for him to put Bismarck
in this sensitive position. His wife, Queen Augusta, had tried to dissuade
him, but although she usually got her way with him, this time William
stuck to his guns.

Only a week after becoming prime minister, Bismarck made an im-
promptu speech to a few dozen ministers to convince them of the need to
enlarge the army. He ended by saying, “The great questions of the time
will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions of majorities, but by iron
and blood.” His speech was immediately disseminated throughout Ger-
many. The queen screamed at her husband that Bismarck was a barbaric
militar-ist who was out to usurp control of Prussia, and that William had to
fire him. The liberals in the government agreed with her. The outcry was
so vehement that Williarn began to be afraid he would end up on a scaf-
fold, like Louis XVI of France, if he kept Bismarck on as prime minister.

Bismarck knew he had to get to the king before it was too late. He also
knew he had blundered, and should have tempered his fiery words. Yet as
he contemplated his strategy, he decided not to apologize but to do the
exact opposite, Bismarck knew the king well.

When the two men met, William, predictably, had been worked into a
tizzy by the queen. He reiterated his fear of being guillotined. But Bismarck
only replied, “Yes, then we shall be dead! We must die sooner or later, and
could there be a more respectable way of dying? I should die lighting for
the cause of my king and master. Your Majesty would die sealing with your
own blood your royal rights granted by God’s graze. Whether upon the
scafiold or upon the battlefield makes no difference to the glorious staking
of body and life on behalf of rights granted by God’s grace!“ On he went,
appealing to William’s sense of honor and the majesty of his position as
head of the army. How could the king allow people to push him around?
Wasn’t the honor of Germany more important than quibbling over words?
Not only did the prime minister convince the king to stand up to both his
wife and his parliament, he persuaded him to build up the am1y—Bis-
matclwfs goal all along.
Interpretation
Bismarck knew the king felt bullied by those around him. He knew that
William had a military background and a deep sense of honor, and that he
felt ashamed at his cravenness before his wife and his government. Wdliam
secretly yearned to be a great and mighty king, but he dared not express
this ambition because he was afraid of ending up like Louis XVI. Where a
show of courage often conceals a man’s timidity, William’s timidity con-
cealed his need to show courage and thump his chest.

Bismarck sensed the longing for glory beneath William’s pacifist front,
so he played to the king’s insecurity about his manhood, finally pushing
him into three wars and the creation of a German empire. Timidity is a. po-
tent weakness to exploit. Timid souls often yearn to be their opposite——to
be Napoleons. Yet they lack the inner strength. You, in essence, can be-
come their Napoleon, pushing them into bold actions that serve your
needs while also making them dependent on you. Remember: Look to the
opposites and never take appearances at face value.

REVERSAL
Playing on people’s weakness has one significant danger: You may stir up
an action you cannot control.

In your games of power you always look several steps ahead and plan
accordingly. And you exploit the fact that other people are more emotional
and incapable of such foresight. But when you play on their vulnerabilities,
the areas over which they have least control, you can unleash emotions
that will upset your plans. Push timid people into bold action and they may
go too far; answer their need for attention or recognition and they may
need more than you want to give them. The helpless, childish element you
are playing on can turn against you.

The more emotional the weakness, the greater the potential danger.
Know the limits to this game, then, and never get carried away by your
control over your victims. You are after power, not the thrill of control.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In July of 1830, a revolution broke out in Paris that forced the king,
Charles X, to abdicate. A commission of the highest authorities in the land
gathered to choose a successor, and the man they picked was Louis-
Philippe, the Duke of Orleans.

From the beginning it was clear that Louis~Philippe would be a differ
am kind of king, and not just because he came from a different branch of
the royal family, or because he had not inherited the crown but had been
given it, by a commission, putting his legitimacy in question. Rather it was
that he disliked ceremony and the trappings of royalty; he had more
friends among the bankers than among the nobility; and his style was not
to create a new kind of royal rule, as Napoleon had done, but to downplay
his status, the better to mix with the businessmen and middle-class folk
who had called him to lead. Thus the symbols that came to be associated
with Louis-Philippe were neither the scepter nor the crown, but the gray
hat and umbrella with which he would proudly walk the streets of Paris, as
if he were a bourgeois out for a stroll. VVhen Louis—Philippe invited James
Rothschild, the most important banker in France, to his palace, he treated
him as an equal. And unlike any king before him, not only did he talk busi-
ness with Monsieur Rothschild but that was literally all he talked, for he
loved money and had amassed a huge fortune.

As the reign of the “bourgeois king” plodded on, people came to de
spire him. The aristocracy could not endure the sight of an unkingly king,
and within a few years they turned on him. Meanwhile the growing class of
the poor, including the radicals who had chased out Charles X, found no
satisfaction in a ruler who neither acted as a king nor governed as a man of
the people. The bankers to whom Louis-Philippe was the most beholden
soon realized that it was they who controlled the country, not he, and they
treated him with growing contempt. One day, at the start of a train trip or-
ganized for the royal family, James Rothschild actually berated him-and
iri public-—for being late. Once the king had made news by treating the
banker as an equal; now the banker treated the king as an inferior.

Eventually the workers’

insurrections that had brought down Louis-
Phi1ippe’s predecessor began to ree.-merge, and the king put them down
with force. But what was he defending so brutally? Not the institution of the
monarchy, which he disdained, nor a democratic republic, which his rule
prevented. What he was really defending, it seemed, was his own fortune,
and the fortunes of the bankers—-not a way to inspire loyalty among the
citizenry.

In early 1848, Frenchmen of all classes began to demonstrate for elec-
toral reforms that would make the country truly democratic. By February
the demonstrations had turned violent. To assuage the populace, Louis-
Philippe fired his prime minister and appointed a liberal as a replacement.
But this created the opposite of the desired effect: The people sensed they
could push the king around. The demonstrations turned into a l&#x27;ull~fledged
revolution, with gunfire and barricades in the streets.

On the night of February 23, a crowd of Parisians surrounded the
palace. With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, Louis-
Philippe abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no sue»
cessor, nor even the suggestion of one-—his whole government folded up
and dissolved like a traveling circus leaving town.

Interpretation
Louis-Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that natu.rally pertains to
kings and leaders. Scoffing at the symbolism of grandeur, he believed a
new world was dawning, where rulers should act and be like ordinary citi
zens. He was right: A new world, without kings and queens, was certainly
on its way. He was profoundly wrong, however, in predicting a change in
the dynamics of power.

The bourgeois king’s hat and umbrella amused the French at first, but
soon grew irritating. People knew that Louis-Philippe was not really like
them at all—that the hat and umbrella were essentially a kind of trick to en-
courage them in the fantasy that the country had suddenly grown more
equal. Actually, though, the divisions of wealth had never been greater.
The French expected their ruler to be a bit of a showman, to have some
presence. Even a radical like Robespierre, who had briefly come to power
during the French Revolution fifty years earlier, had understood this, and
cenainly Napoleon, who had turned the revolutionary republic into an im
per-ial regime, had known it in his bones. Indeed as soon as Louis—Phi1ippe

Powerful people may be tempted to affect a common-man aura, trying
to create the illusion that they and their subjects or underlings are basically
the same. But the people whom this false gesture is intended to impress will
quickly see through it. They understand that they are not being given more
power——that it only appears as if they shared in the powerful person’s fate.
The only kind of common touch that works is the kind ailected by Franklin
Roosevelt, a style that said the president shared values and goals with the
common people even while he remained a patrician at heart. He never
pretended to erase his distance from the crowd.

Leaders who try to dissolve that distance through a false chumrniness
gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love. Instead they elicit
contempt. Like Louis—Philippe, they are too uninspiring even to be worth
the guillotine-——the best they can do is simply vanish in the night, as if they
were never there.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
When Christopher Columbus was trying to find funding for his legendary
voyages, many around him believed he came from the Italian aristocracy.
This view was passed into history through a biography written after the ex-
plorer’s death by his son, which describes him as a descendant of a Count

Colombo of the Castle of Cuccaro in Montferrat. Colombo in turn was said
to be descended from the legendary Roman general Colonius, and two of
his first cousins were supposedly direct descendants of an emperor of Con
stantinople. An illustrious background indeed. But it was nothing more
than illustrious fantasy, for Columbus was actually the son of Domenico
Colombo, a humble weaver who had opened a wine shop when Christa»
pher was a young man, and who then made his living by selling cheese.

Columbus himself had created the myth of his noble background, be-
cause from early on he felt that destiny had singled him out for great
things, and that he had a kind of royalty in his blood. Accordingly he acted
as if he were indeed descended from noble stock. After an uneventful ca-
reer as a merchant on 3 commercial vessel, Columbus, Originally from
Genoa, settled in Lisbon. Using the fabricated story of his noble back
ground, he married into an established Lisbon family that had excellent
connections with Portuguese royalty.

Through his in—laws, Columbus finagled a meeting with the king of
Portugahjoao II, whom he petitioned to finance a westward voyage aimed
at discovering a shorter route to Asia. In return for announcing that any
discoveries he achieved would be made in the kings name, Columbus
Ihwanted a series of rights: the title Grand Admiral of the Oceanic Sea; the
office of Viceroy over any lands he found; and 10 percent of the future
commerce with such lands. All of these rights were to be hereditary and for
all time. Columbus made these demands even though he had previously
been a mere merchant, he knew almost nothing about navigation, he could
not work a quadrant, and he had never led a group of men. In short he had
absolutely no qualifications for the journey he proposed. Furthermore, his
petition included no details as to how he would accomplish his plans, just
vague promises.

“Then Columbus finished his pitch, joao II smiled: He politely de-
clined the offer, but left the door open for the future. Here Columbus must
have noticed something he would never forget: Even as the king turned
down the sailor’s demands, he treated them as legitimate. He neither
laughed at Columbus nor questioned his background and credentials. In
fact the king was impressed by the boldness of Columbus’s requests, and
clearly felt comfortable in the company of a man who acted so confidently.
The meeting must have convinced Columbus that his instincts were cor‘
rect: By asking for the moon, he had instantly raised his own status, for the
king assumed that unless a man who set such a high price on himself were
mad, which Columbus did not appear to be, he must somehow be worth it.
A few years later Columbus moved to Spain. Using his Portuguese
connections, he moved in elevated circles at the Spanish court, receiving
subsidies from illustrious financiers and sharing tables with dukes and
princes. To all these men be repeated his request for financing for a voyage
to the we-st——and also for the rights he had demanded from joao II. Some,
such as the powerful duke of Medina, wanted to help, but could not, since
they lacked the power to grant him the titles and rights he wanted, But
Columbus would not back down. He soon realized that only one person

could meet his demands: Queen Isabella. In 1487 he finally managed a
meeting with the queen, and although he could not convince her to finance
the voyage, he completely charmed her, and became a frequent guest in
the palace.

In 1492 the Spanish finally expelled the Moorish invaders who cen-
turies earlier had seized parts of the country. With the wartime burden on
her treasury lifted, Isabella felt she could finally respond to the demands of
her explorer friend, and she decided to pay for three ships, equipment, the
salaries of the crews, and a modest stipend for Columbus. More important,
she had a. contract drawn up that granted Columbus the titles and rights on
which he had insisted. The only one she denied——and only in the contract’s
fine print—was the 10 percent of all revenues from any lands discovered:
an absurd demand, since he wanted no time limit on it. (Had the clause
been left in, it would eventually have made Columbus and his heirs the
wealthiest family on the planet. Columbus never read the fine print.)

Satisfied that his demands had been met, Columbus set sail that same
year in search of the passage to Asia. (Before he left he was careful to hire
the best navigator he could find to help him get there.) The mission failed
to find such a passage, yet when Columbus petitioned the queen to finance
an even more ambitious voyage the following year, she agreed. By then
she had come to see Columbus as destined for great things.

Interpretation
As an explorer Columbus was mediocre at best. He knew less about the
sea than did the average sailor on his ships, could never determine the lati-
tude and longitude of his discoveries, mistook islands for vast continents,
and treated his crew badly. But in one area he was a genius: He knew how
to sell himself. How else to explain how the son of a cheese vendor, a. low-
level sea merchant, managed to ingratiate himself with the highest royal
and aristocratic families?

Columbus had an amazing power to charm the nobility, and it all
came from the way he carried himself. He projected a sense of confidence
that was completely out of proportion to his means. Nor was his confidence
the aggressive, ugly selfipromotion of an upsmrt—it was a quiet and calm
selflassurance. In fact it was the same confidence usually shown by the no
bility themselves. The powerful in the o1d—style aristocracies felt no need to
prove or assert themselves; being noble, they knew they always deserved
more, and asked for it. With Columbus, then, they felt an instant aflinity,
for he carried himself just the way they clid——elevated above the crowd,
destined for greatness.

Understand: It is within your power to set your own price. How you
carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. If you ask for little, shuf-
fle your feet and lower your head, people will assume this reflects your
character. But this behavior is not you»-—it is only how you have chosen to
present yourself to other people. You can just as easily present the Colum~
bus front: buoyancy, confidence, and the feeling that you were born to

wear a crown.

With all great decsivm there is a noteworthy occummre to which they owe their
power. In the actual act ofdeception they are overcome by belief in themselves: it is
this which then speaks so miraculously and campellingly to those mound them.

KEYS TO POWER
As children, we start our lives with great exuberance, expecting and de-
manding everything from the world. This generally carries over into our
first forays into society, as we begin our careers. But as we grow older the
rebuffs and failures we experience set up boundaries that only get firmer
with time. Coming to expect less from the world, we accept limitations that
are really self-imposed. ‘We start to bow and scrape and apologize for even
the simplest of requests. The solution Lo such a shrinking of horizons is to
deliberately force ourselves in the opposite direction-——to downplay the
failures and ignore the limitations, to make ourselves demand and expect
as much as the child. To accomplish this, we must use a particular strategy
upon ourselves. Call it the Strategy of the Crown.

The Strategy of the Crown is based on a simple chain of cause and ef-
fect: If we believe we are destined for great things, our belief will radiate
outward, just as a crown creates an aura around a king. This outward radi-
ance will infect the people around us, who will think we must have reasons
to feel so confident. People who wear crowns seem to feel no inner sense of
the limits to what they can ask for or what they can accomplish. This too
radiates outward. Limits and boundaries disappear. Use the Strategy of the
Crown and you will be surprised how often it bears fruit. Take as an exa.m~
ple those happy children who ask for whatever they want, and get it. Their
high expectations are their charm. Adults enjoy granting their wishes-——just
as Isabella enjoyed granting the wishes of Columbus.

Throughout history, people of undistinguished birth-—-the Theodora: of
‘ Byzantium, the Columbuses, the Beethovens, the Disraelis-——-have managed
to work the Strategy of the Crown, believing so firmly in their own greatness
that it becomes a seIf~fulfil1ing prophecy. The trick is simple: Be overcome
by your selfibelief. Even while you know you are practicing a kind of de-
ception on yourself, act like a king. You are likely to be treated as one.

The crown may separate you from other people, but it is up to you to
make that separation real: You have to act differently, demonstrating your
distance from those around you. One way to emphasize your difference is
to always act with dignity, no matter the circumstance. Louis~Philippe gave
no sense of being different from other people—he was the banker king.
And the moment his subjects threatened him, he caved in. Everyone
sensed this and pounced. Lacking regal dignity and firmness of purpose,
Louis-Philippe seemed an impostor, and the crown was easily toppled
from his head.

Regal bearing should not be confused with arrogance. Arrogance may
seem the king’s entitlement, but in fact it betrays insecurity. It is the very
opposite of a royal demeanor.

Haile Selassie, ruler of Ethiopia for forty or so years beginning in 1930,
was once a young man named Lij Tafari. He came from a noble family, but
there was no real chance of him coming to power, for he was far down the
line of succession from the king then on the throne, Menelik II. Neverthe-
less, from an early age he exhibited a self~coufidence and a royal bearing
that surprised everyone around him.

At the age of fourteen, Tafari went to live at the court, where he imme—
diately impressed Menelik and became his favorite. Tafarfs grace under
fire, his patience, and his calm selflassurance fascinated the king. The other
young nobles, arrogant, blustery, and envious, would push this slight,
bookish teenager around. But he never got angry-—-that would have been a
sign of insecurity, to which he would not stoop. There were already people
around him who felt he would someday rise to the top, for he acted as if he
were already there.

Years later, in 1936, when the Italian Fascists had taken over Ethiopia
and Tafari, now called Haile Selassie, was in exile, he addressed the League
of Nations to plead his country’s case. The Italians in the audience heckled
him with vulgar abuse, but he maintained his dignified pose, as if com-
pletely unaffected. This elevated him while making his opponents look
even uglier. Dignity, in fact, is invariably the mask to assume under difficult
circumstances: It is as if nothing can affect you, and you have all the time
in the world to respond. This is an extremely powerful pose.

A royal demeanor has other uses. Con artists have long known the
value of an aristocratic front; it either disazms people and makes them less
suspicious, or else it intimidates them and puts them on the defensive———and
as Count Victor Lustig knew, once you put a sucker on the defensive he is
doomed. The con man Yellow Kid Well, too, would often assume the trap
pings of a man of wealth, along with the nonchalance that goes with them.
Alluding to some magical method of making money, he would stand aloof,
like a king, exuding confidence as if he really were fabulously rich. The
suckers would beg to be in on the con, to have a chance at the wealth that
he so clearly displayed.

Finally, to reinforce the inner psychological tricks involved in project-
ing a royal demeanor, there are outward strategies to help you create the
effect. First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold demand. Set your
price high and do not waver. Second, in a dignified way, go after the high-
est person in the building. This immediately puts you on the same plane as
the chief executive you are attacking. It is the David and Goliath Strategy:
By choosing a great opponent, you create the appearance of greatness.

Third, give a gift of some sort to those above you. This is the strategy
of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you are essentially
saying that the two of you are equal. It is the old con game of giving so that
you can take. When the Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino wanted the
Duke of Mantua as his nerd patron, he knew that if he was slavish and
sycophantic, the duke would think him unworthy; so he approached the
duke with gifts, in this case paintings by the wn‘ter’s good friend Titian.

288

LAW 34

Accepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and writer: The
duke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing with a man of his
own aristocratic stamp. He funded Aretino generously. The gift strategy is
subtle and brilliant because you do not beg: You ask for help in a dignified
way that implies equality between two people, one of whom just happens
to have more money.

Remember: It is up to you to set your own price. As}: for less and that
is just what you will get Ask for more, however, and you send a signal that
you are worth a king’s ransom. Even those who turn you down respect you
for your confidence, and that respect will eventually pay off in ways you
cannot imagine.

Image: The Crown. Place it upon your head
and you assume a different pose——tranqui1
yet radiating assurance. Never show
doubt, never lose your dignity beneath
the crown, or it will not fit. It will seem
to be destined for one more worthy. Do
not wait for a coronation; the great»
est emperors crown themselves.

Authority: Everyone should be royal after his own fashion. Let all your
actions, even though they are not those of a king, be,
in their own
sphere, worthy of one. BC sublime in your deeds,
lofty in your
thoughts; and in all your doings Show that you deserve to be a king
even though you are not one in reality. (Baltasar Gracizin, l60l~lC&gt;58)

R EV E RSAL
The idea behind the assumption of regal confidence is to set yourself apart
from other people, but if you take this too far it will be your undoing.
Never make the mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself by humiliat-
ing people. Also, it is never a good idea to loom too high above the
crowcl—you make an easy target. And there are times when an aristocratic
pose is eminently dangerous.

Charles I, king of England during the 16405, faced a profound public
disenchantment with the institution of monarchy. Revolts erupted through»
out the country, led by Oliver Cromwell. Had Charles reacted to the times
with insight, supporting reforms and making a show of sacrificing some of
his power, history might have been different. Instead he reverted to an
even more regal pose, seeming outraged by the assault on his power and
on the divine institution of monarchy. His stiff kingliness offended people
and spurred on their revolts. And eventually Charles lost his head, literally
Understand: You are radiating confidence, not arrogance or disdain.

Finally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power through af-
fecting a kind of earthy vulgarity, which will prove amusing by its extreme-
ness. But to the extent that you win this game by going beyond the limits,
separating yourself from other people by appearing even more vulgar than
they are, the game is dangerous: There will always be people more vulgar
than you, and you will easily be replaced the following season by someone
younger and worse.

OBSERVAN CE OF THE LAW
Starting out in life as a nondescript French seminary-school teacher, Joseph
Fouché wandered from town to town for most of the decade of the 17805,
teaching mathematics to young boys. Yet he never completely committed
himself to the church, never took his vows as a pn&#x27;est—he had bigger plans.
Patiently waiting for his chance, he kept his options open. And when the
French Revolution broke out, in 1789, Fouché waited no longer: He got rid
of his cassock, grew his hair long, and became a revolutionary. For this was
the spirit of the times. To miss the boat at this critical moment could have
spelt disaster. Fouché did not miss the boat: Befriending the revolutionary
leader Robespierre, he quickly rose in the rebel ranks. In 1792 the town of
Nantes elected Fouché to be its representative to the National Convention
(created that year to frame a new constitution for a French republic).

When Fouché arrived in Paris to take his seat at the convention, a vio-
lent rift had broken out between the moderates and the radical Jacobins.
Fouché sensed that in the long run neither side would emerge victorious.
Power rarely ends up in the hands of those who start a revolution, or even
of those who further it; power sticks to those who bring it to a conclusion.
That was the side Fouché wanted to be on.

His sense of timing was uncanny. He started as a moderate, for moderv
ates were in the majority. When the time came to decide on whether or not
to execute Louis XVI, however, he saw that the people were clamoring for
the king’s head, so he cast the deciding vote~—for the guillotine. Now he
had become a radical. Yet as tensions came to the boil in Paris, he foresaw
the danger of being too closely associated with any one faction, so he ac-
cepted a position in the provinces, where he could lie low for a while. A
few months later he was assigned to the post of proconsul in Lyons, where
he oversaw the execution of dozens of aristocrats. At a certain moment,
however, he called a halt to the killings, sensing that the mood of the coun-
ny was turning—and despite the blood already on his hands, the citizens of
Lyons hailed him as a savior from what had become known as the Terror.
So far Fouché had played his cards brilliantly, but in 1794 his old
friend Robespierre recalled him to Paris to account for his actions in Lyons.
Robespierre had been the driving force behind the Terror. He had sent
heads on both the right and the left rolling, and Fouché, whom he no
longer trusted, seemed destined to provide the next head. Over the next
few weeks, a tense struggle ensued: While Robespierre railed openly
against Fouché, accusing of him dangerous ambitions and calling for his ar»
the crafty Fouché worked more indirectly, quietly gaining support
rest,
among those who were beginning to tire of Robespierre’s dictatorial con-
trol. Fouché was playing for time. He knew that the longer he survived, the
more disaffected citizens he could rally against Robespierre. He had to
have broad support before he moved against the powerful leader. He ral-
lied support among both the moderates and the jacobins, playing on the
widespread fear of Robespierre-—everyone was afraid of being the next to
go to the guillotine. It all came to fruition on July 27: The convention

Wlhen Fouché returned to the convention after Robespien-e’s death, he
played his most unexpected move: Having led the conspiracy against

he once again changed sides, joining the radical Jacobins. For perhaps the
first time in his life he aligned himself with the minority. Clearly he sensed
a reaction stirring: He knew that the moderate faction that had executed
Robespierre, and was now about to take power, would initiate a new round
of the Terror, this time against the radicals. In siding with the jacobins,
then, Fouché was sitting with the martyrs of the days to eome—the people
who would be considered blameless in the troubles that were on their way.
Taking sides with what was about to become the losing team was a risky
gambit, of course, but Fouché must have calculated he could keep his head
long enough to quietly stir up the populace against the moderates and
watch them fall from power. And indeed, although the moderates did call
for his arrest in December of 1795, and would have sent him to the guillo~
line, too much time had passed. The executions had become unpopular
with the people, and Fouché survived the swing of the pendulum one more
time.

A new government took over, the Directoire. It was not, however, a
jacobin government, but a moderate one-———more moderate than the gov‘
emment that had reimposed the Terror. Fouché, the radical, had kept his
head, but now he had to keep a low profile. He waited patiently on the
sidelines for several years, allowing time to soften any bitter feelings
against him, then he approached the Directoire and convinced them he
had a new passion: intelligencegathering. He became a paid spy for the
government, excelled at the job, and in 1799 was rewarded by being made
minister of police. Now he was not just empowered but required to extend
his spying to every corner of Fra.nce—-~a responsibility that would greatly
reinforce his natural ability to sniff out where the wind was blowing. One
of the first social
in fact, came in the person of
Napoleon, a brash young general whose destiny he right away saw was en-
twined with the future of France. When Napoleon unleashed a coup d’état,
on November 9, 1799, Fouché pretended to be asleep. Indeed he slept the
whole day. For this indirect assistance-«it might have been thought his job,
after all, to prevent a military coup-—Napoleou kept him on as minister of
police in the new regime.

trends he detected,

Over the next few years, Napoleon came to rely on Fcmché more and
more. He even gave this former revolutionary a title, duke of Otranto, and
rewarded him with great wealth. By 1808, however, Fouché, always at-
tuned to the times, sensed that Napoleon was on the downswing. His futile
war with Spain, a country that posed no threat to France, was a sign that he
was losing a sense of proportion. Never one to be caught on a sinking ship,

though the conspiracy failed—Talleyrand was fired; Fouché stayed, but
was kept on a tight leash—it publicized a growing discontent with the em-
peror, who seemed to be losing control. By 1814 Napoleon’s power had
crumbled and allied forces finally conquered him.

The next government was a restoration of the monarchy, in the form
of King Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI. Fouché, his nose always sniff-
ing the air for the next social shift, knew Louis would not last long—he had
none of Napoleon&#x27;s flair. Fouché once again played his waiting game, lying
low, staying away from the spotlight. Sure enough, in February of 1815,
Napoleon escaped from the island of Elba, where he had been imprisoned.
Louis XVIII panicked: His policies had alienated the citizenry, who were
clamoring for Nap0leon’s return. So Louis turned to the one man who
could maybe have saved his hide, Fouché, the former radical who had sent
his brother, Louis XVI, to the guillotine, but was now one of the most pop-
ular and widely admired politicians in France. Fouché, however, would not
side with a loser: He refused Louis’s request for help by pretending that his
help was unnecessaiy—by swearing that Napoleon would never return
to power (although he knew otherwise). A short time later, of course,
Napoleon and his new citizen army were closing in on Paris.

Seeing his reign about to collapse, feeling that Fouché had betrayed
him, and certain that he did not want this powerful and able man on
Napoleon’s team, King Louis ordered the Ini.n.ister’s arrest and execution.
On March 16, 1815, policemen surrounded Fouché’s coach on a Paris
boulevard. Was this finally his end? Perhaps, but not immediately: Fouché
told the police that an exvmember of government could not be arrested on
the street. They fell for the story and allowed him to retum home. Later
that day, though, they came to his house and once again declared him
under arrest. Fouché nodded—but would the officers be so kind as allow a
gentleman to wash and to change his clothes before leaving his house for
the last time? They gave their permission, Fouché left the room, and the
minutes went by. Fouché did not return. Finally the policemen went into
the next room—where they saw a ladder against an open window, leading
down to the garden below.

That day and the next the police combed Paris for Fouché, but by then
Napoleon’s cannons were audible in the distance and the king and all the
king’s men had to flee the city. As soon as Napoleon entered Paris, Fouché
came out of hiding. He had cheated the executioner once again. Napoleon
greeted his former minister of police and gladly restored him to his old
post. During the 100 days that Napoleon remained in power, until Water-
loo, it was essentially Fouché who governed France. Alter Napoleon fell,
Louis XVIII returned to the throne, and like a cat with nine lives, Fouché
stayed on to serve in yet another goVemment—by then his power and in-
fluence had grown so great that not even the king dared challenge him.

Interpretation
In a period of unprecedented turmoil, Joseph Fouché thrived through his
mastery of the art of timing. He teaches us a number of key lessons.

First, it is critical to recognize the spirit of the times. Fouché always
looked two steps ahead, found the wave that would carry him to power,
and rode it. You must always work with the times, anticipate twists and
turns, and never miss the boat. Sometimes the spirit of the times is obscure:
Recognize it not by what is loudest and most obvious in it, but by what lies
hidden and dormant. Look forward to die Napoleons of the future rather
than holding on to the ruins of the past.

Second, recognizing the prevailing winds does not necessarily mean
running with them. Any potent social movement creates a powerful reac-
tion, and it is wise to anticipate what that reaction will be, as Fouché did
after the execution of Robespierre. Rather than ride the cresting wave of
the moment, wait for the tide’s ebb to carry you back to power. Upon occa~
sion bet on the reaction that is brewing, and place yourself in the vanguard
of it.

Finally, Fouché had remarkable patience. Without patience as your
sword and shield, your timing will fail and you will inevitably find yourself
aloser. When the times were against Fouché, he did not struggle, get emo-
tional, or strike out rashly. He kept his cool and maintained a low profile,
patiently building support among the citizenry, the bulwark in his next rise
to power. Whenever he found himself in the weaker position, he played for
time, which he knew would always be his ally if he was patient. Recognize
the moment, then, to hide in the grass or slither under a rock, as well as the
moment to bare your fangs and attack.

Space we can recover, time never.
N:1;tmle07: Bomzpanle, 1 769-1821

KEYS TO POWER
Time is an artificial concept that we ourselves have created to make the
limitlessness of eternity and the universe more bearable, more human.
Since we have constructed the concept of time, we are also able to mold it
to some degree, to play tricks with it. The time of a child is long and slow,
with vast expanses;
the time of an adult whizzes by frighteningly fast.
Time, then, depends on perception, which, we know, can be willfully al-
tered. This is the first thing to understand in mastering the art of timing. If
the inner turmoil caused by our emotions tends to make time move faster,
it follows that once we control our emotional responses to events, time will
move much more slowly. This altered way of dealing with things tends to
lengthen our perception of future time, opens up possibilities that fear and
anger close off, and allows us the patience that is the principal requirement
in the art of timing.

There are three kinds of time for us to deal with; each presents prob-
lems that can be solved with skill and practice. First there is long time: the
drawn»out, years—long kind of time that must be managed with patience
and gentle guidance. Our handling of long time should be mostly defen-
sive—this is the art of not reacting impulsively, of waiting for opportunity.

Next there is fimed time: the short—term time that we can manipulate as an
offensive weapon, upsetting the timing of our opponents. Finally there is
end lime, when a plan must be executed with speed and force. We have
waited, found the moment, and must not hesitate.

Long Time. The famous seventeenth-century Ming painter Chou Yung
relates a story that altered his behavior forever. Late one winter afternoon
he set out to visit a town that lay across the river from his own town. He
was bringing some important books and papers with him and had commis-
sioned a young boy to help him carry them. As the ferry neared the other
side of the river, Chou Yung asked the boatman if they would have time to
get to the town before its gates closed, since it was a mile away and night
was approaching. The boatman glanced at the boy, and at the bundle of
loosely tied papers and books-“Yes,” he replied, “if you do not walk too
fast.”

As they started out, however, the sun was setting. Afraid of being
locked out of the town at night, prey to local bandits, Chou and the boy
walked faster and faster, finally breaking into a run. Suddenly the string
around the papers broke and the documents scattered on the ground. It
took them many minutes to put the packet together again, and by the time
they had reached the city gates, it was too late.

When you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a nest
of problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much longer than if
you had taken your time. Hurriers may occasionally get there quicker, but
papers fly everywhere, new dangers arise, and they find themselves in con-
stant crisis mode, fixing the problems that they themselves have created.
Sometimes not acting in the face of danger is your best move»-you wait,
you deliberately slow down. As time passes it will eventually present op
portunities you had not imagined.

Waiting involves controlling not only your own emotions but those of
your colleagues, who, mistaking acfion for power, may try to push you into
making rash moves. In your rivals, on the other hand, you can encourage
this same mistake: If you let them rush headlong into trouble while you
stand back and wait, you will soon find ripe moments to intervene and pick
up the pieces. This wise policy was the principal strategy of the great early-
seventeenthcentury emperor Tokugawa Ieyasu ofjapan. When his prede~
cessor, the headstrong Hideyoshi, whom he served as 3. general, staged a
rash invasion of Korea, leyasu did not involve himself. He knew the inva-
sion would be a disaster and would lead to Hideyoshfs downfall, Better to
stand patiently on the sidelines, even fin many years, and then be in position
to seize power when the time is rightmexactly what Ieyasu did, with great
anistry.

You do not deliberately slow time down to live longer, or to take more
pleasure in the moment, but the better to play the game of power. First,
when your mind is uncluttered by constant emergencies you will see fur»
ther into the future. Second, you will be able to resist the baits that people

dangle in front of you, and will keep yourself from becoming another im~
patient sucker. Third, you will have more room to be flexible. Opportuni-
ties will inevitably arise that you had not expected and would have missed
had you forced the pace. Fourth, you will not move from one deal to the
next without completing the first one. To build your power’s foundation
can take years; make sure that foundation is secure. Do not be a flash in the
pan—-«success that is built up slowly and surely is the only kind that lasts.

Finally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the times
you live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in a less
emotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come. Hurriers
will often mistake surface phenomena for a real trend, seeing only what
they want to see. How much better to see what is really happening, even if
it is unpleasant or makes your task harder.

Forced Time. The trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of others-——t0
make them hurry, to make them wait, to make them abandon their own
pace, to distort their perception of time. By upsetting the timing of your op~
ponent while you stay patient, you open up time for yourself, which is half
the game.

In 1473 the great Turkish sultan Mehmed the Conqueror invited nego-
tiations with Hungary to end the elf-andam war the two countries had
waged for years. When the Hungarian emissary arrived in Turkey to start
the talks, Turkish officials humbly apologized——Mehmed had just left Istan-
bul, the capital, to battle his longtime foe, Uzun Hasan. But he urgently
wanted peace with Hungary, and had asked that the emissary join him at
the front.

When the emissary anived at the site of the fighting, Mehmed had al-
ready left it, moving eastward in pursuit of his swift foe. This happened
several times. Wherever the emissary stopped, the Thrks lavished gifts and
banquets on him, in pleasurable but timeconsuming ceremonies. Finally
Mehrned defeated Uzun and met with the emissary. Yet his terms for peace
with Hungary were excessively harsh. After a few days, the negotiations
ended, and the usual stalemate remained in place. But this was fine with
Mehmecl. In fact he had planned it that way all along: Plotting his cam-
paign against Uzun, he had seen that diverting his armies to the east would
leave his western flank vulnerable. To prevent Hungary from taking advan»
tage of his weakness and his preoccupation elsewhere, he flrst dangled the
lure of peace before his enemy, then made them wait»-all on his own
terms.

Making people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as they
do not figure out what you are up to. You control the clock, they linger in
limbowand rapidly come unglued, opening up opportunities for you to
strike. The opposite effect is equally powerful: You make your opponents
hurry. Start off your dealings with them slowly, then suddenly apply pres-
sure, making them feel that everything is happening at once. People who
lack the time to think will make mistakes-—so set their deadlines for them.

This was the technique Machiavelli admired in Cesare Borgia, who, during
negotiations, would suddenly press vehemently for a decision, upsetting
his opponent’s timing and patience. For who would dare make Cesare
wait?

Joseph Duveen, the famous art dealer, knew that if he gave an indeci-
sive buyer like John D. Rockefeller a deadline»-the painting had to leave
the country, another tycoon was interested in it—the client would buy just
in time. Freud noticed that patients who had spent years in psychoanalysis
without improvement would miraculously recover just in time if he fixed a
definite date for the end of the therapy. Jacques Lacan, the famous French
psychoanalyst, used a variation on this tactic—he would sometimes end
the customary hour session of therapy after only ten minutes, without
warning. After this happened several times, the patient would realize that
he had better make maximum use of the time, rather than wasting much of
the hour with a lot of talk that meant nothing. The deadline, then, is a pow-
erful tool. Close off the vistas of indecision and force people to make up
their damn minds or get to the point—never let them make you play on
their excruciating terms. Never give them time.

Magicians and showmen are experts in forcing time. Houdini could
often wriggle free of handcuffs in minutes, but he would draw the escape
out to an hour, making the audience sweat, as time came to an apparent
standstill. Magicians have always known that the best way to alter our pet-
ception of time is often to slow down the pace. Creating suspense brings
time to a terrifying pause: The slower the magician’s hands move, the eas-
ier it is to create the illusion of speed, making people think the rabbit has
appeared instantaneously. The great nineteenthcentury magician _]ean—Eu—
gene Robert~Houdin took explicit notice of this effect: “The more slowly a
story is told,” he said, “the shorter it seems.”

Going slower also makes wha). you are doing more interesting»-the
audience yields to your pace, becomes entranced. It is a state in which time
whizzes delightfully by. You must practice such illusions, which share in the
hypnotisfs power to alter perceptions of time.

End Time. You can play the game with the utmost artistry—--waiting pa-
tiently for the right moment to act, putting your competitors off their form
by messing with their timing~—-but it won’t mean a thing unless you know
how to finish. Do not be one of those people who look like paragons of pa«
tieuce but are actually just afraid to bring things to a close: Patience is
worthless unless combined with a willingness to fall ruthlessly on your op-
ponent at the right moment. You can wait as long as necessary for the con
clusion to come, but when it comes it must come quickly. Use speed to
paralyze your opponent, cover up any mistakes you might make, and im-
press people with your aura of authority and finality.

With the patience of a snake charmer, you draw the snake out with
calm and steady rhythms. Once the snake is out, though, would you dangle
your foot above its deadly head? There is never a good reason to allow the

LAW 3.1

slightest hitch in your endgame. Your mastery of timing can really only be
judged by how you work with end time——-how you quickly change the pace
and bring things to a swift and definitive conclusion.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
The Mexican rebel leader Pancho Villa started out as the chief of a gang of
bandits, but after revolution broke out in Mexico in 1910, he became a.
kind of folk hero—robbing trains and giving the money to the poor, lead
ing daring raids, and charming the ladies with romantic escapades. His ex-
ploits fascinated Americans—he seemed a man from another era, part
Robin Hood, part Don Juan. After a few years of bitter fighting, however,
General Carranza emerged as the victor in the Revolution; the defeated
Villa and his troops went back home, to the northern state of Chihuahua.
His army dwindled and he turned to banditry again, damaging his popu-
larity. Finally, perhaps out of desperation, he began to rail against the
United States, the gringos, whom he blamed for his troubles.

In March of 1916, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico. Ram»
paging through the town, he and his gang killed seventeen American sol-
diers and civilians. President Woodrow Wilson, like many Americans, had
admired Villa; now, however, the bandit needed to be punished. Wilson’s
advisers urged him to send troops into Mexico to capture Villa. For a
power as large as the United States, they argued, not to strike back at an
army that had invaded its territory would send the worst kind of signal.
Furthermore, they continued, many Americans saw Wilson as a pacifist, a
principle the public doubted as a response to violence; he needed to prove
his mettle and manliness by ordering the use of force.

The pressure on Wflson was strong, and before the month was out,
with the approval of the Carranza government, he sent an army of ten
thousand soldiers to capture Pancho Villa. The venture was called the
Punitive Expedition, and its leader was the dashing General john
Persh-
ing, who had defeated guerrillas in the Philippines and Native Americans
in the American Southwest. Certainly Pershing could find and overpower
Pancho Villa.

The Punitive Expedition became a sensational story, and carloads of
US. reporters followed Pershing into action. The campaign, they wrote,
would be a test of American power. The soldiers carried the latest in
weaponry, communicated by radio, and were supported by reconnais-
sance from the air.

In the first few months, the troops split up into small units to comb the
wilds of northern Mexico. The Americans offered a $50,000 rewmd for in-
fonnation leading to Villa’s capture. But the Mexican people, who had
been disillusioned with Villa when he had returned to banditry, now idol-
ized him for facing this mighty American army. They began to give Persh-
ing false leads: Villa had been seen in this village, or in that mountain
hideaway, airplanes would be dispatched, troops would scurry after them,
and no one would ever see him. The wily bandit seemed to be always one
step ahead of the American military.

By the summer of that year, the expedition had swelled to 123,000
men. They suffered through the stultifying heat, the mosquitoes, the wild
terrain. Trudging over a countryside in which they were already resented,

they infuriated both the local people and the Mexican government. At one
point Pancho Villa hid in a mountain cave to recover from a. gunshot
wound he received in a skirmish with the Mexican army; looking down
from his aerie, he could watch Pershing lead the exhausted American
troops back and forth across the mountains, never getting any closer to
their goal.

All the way into winter, Villa played his cat-and—mouse game. Ameri-
cans came to see the affair as a kind of slapstick fa,rce—in fact they began to
admire Villa again, respecting his resourcefulness in eluding a superior
force. In January of 1917, Wilson finally ordered Pershing’s withdrawal. As
the troops made their way back to American territory, rebel forces pursued
them, forcing the U.S. Army to use airplanes to protect its rear flanks. The
Punitive Expedition was being punished itself—it had turned into a retreat
of the most humiliating sort.

Interpretation
Woodrow Wilson organized the Punitive Expedition as a show of force: He
would teach Pancho Villa a lesson and in the process Show the world that
no one, large or small, could attack the mighty United States and get away
with it. The expedition would be over in a few weeks, and Villa would be
forgotten,

That was not how it played out. The longer the expedition took, the
more it focused attention on the Americans’ incompetence and on Villa’s
cleverness. Soon what was forgotten was not Villa but the raid that had
started it all. As a minor annoyance became an international embarrass-
ment, and the enraged Americans dispatched more troops, the imbalance
between the size of the pursuer and the size of the pursued—who still man-
aged to stay free—ma.de the affair a joke. And in the end this white ele-
phant of an army had to lumber out of Mexico, humiliated. The Punitive
Expedition did the opposite of what it set out to do: It left Villa not only
free but more popular than ever.

What could Wilson have done differently? He could have pressured
the Carranza government to catch Villa for him. Alternatively, since many
Mexicans had tired of Villa before the Punitive Expedition began, he could
have worked quietly with them and won their support for a much smaller
raid to capture the bandit. He could have organized a trap on the Ameri-
can side of die border, anticipating the next raid. Or he could have ignored
the matter altogether for the time being, waiting for the Mexicans them-
selves to do away with Villa of their own accord.

Remember: You choose to let things bother you. You can just as easily
choose not to notice the irritating offender, to consider the matter trivial
and unworthy of your interest That is the powerful move. What you do
not react to cannot drag you down in a futile engagement. Your pride is not
involved. The best lesson you can teach an irritating gnat is to consign it to
oblivion by ignoring it. If it is impossible to ignore (Pancho Villa had in fact
killed American citizens), then conspire in secret to do away with it, but

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the year 1527, King Henry VIII of England decided he had to find a
way to get rid of his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Catherine had failed to pro-
duce a son, a male heir who would ensure the continuance of his dynasty,
and Henry thought he knew why: He had read in the Bible the passage,
“And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath
uncovered his brother‘s nakedness; they shall be childless.” Before marry
ing Henry, Catherine had married his older brother Arthur, but Arthur
had died five months later. Henry had waited an appropriate time, then
had married his brother’s widow.

Catherine was the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of
Spain, and by marrying her Henry had kept alive a valuable alliance. Now,
however, Catherine had to assure him that her brief marriage with Arthur
had never been consummated. Otherwise Henry would view their rela-
tionship as incestuous and their marriage as null and void. Catherine in-
sisted that she had remained a virgin through her marriage to Arthur, and
Pope Clement VII supported her by giving his blessing to the union, which
he could not have done had he considered it incestuous. Yet after years of
marriage to Henry, Catherine had failed to produce a son, and in the early
1520s she had entered menopause. To the king this could only mean one
thing: She had lied about her virginity, their union was incesmous, and
God had punished them.

There was another reason why Henry wanted to get rid of Catherine:
He had fallen in love with a younger woman, Anne Boleyn. Not only was
he in love with her, but if he married her he could still hope to sire a legiti-
mate son. The marriage to Catherine had to be annulled. For this, how-
ever, Henry had to apply to the Vatican. But Pope Clement would never
annul the marriage,

to attempt

By the summer of 1527, rumors spread throughout Europe that Henry
the impossible-—to annul his marriage against
was about
Clement’s wishes. Catherine would never abdicate, let alone voluntarily
enter a nunnery, as Henry had urged her. But Henry had his own strategy:
He stopped sleeping in the same bed with Catherine, since he considered
her his sister~in-law, not his lawful wife. He insisted on calling her Princess

Dowager of Wales, her title as A.rthur’s widow. Finally, in 1531, he ban-
ished her from court and shipped her off to a distant castle. The pope or»
dared him to return her to court, on pain of excommunication, the most
severe penalty a Catholic could suffer. Henry not only ignored this threat,
he insisted that his marriage to Catherine had been dissolved, and in 1533
he married Anne Boleyn.

Clement refused to recognize the marriage, but Henry did not care.
He no longer recognized the pope‘s authority, and proceeded to break
with the Roman Catholic Church, establishing the Church of England in
its stead, with the king as the head of the new church. And so, not surpris-
ingly, the newly formed Church of England proclaimed Anne Boleyn Eng-
land’s rightful queen.

The pope tried every threat in the book, but nothing worked. Henry
simply ignored him. Clement fumed—no one had ever treated him so con-
temptuously. Henry had humiliated him and he had no power of recourse.
Even excommunication (which he constantly threatened but never camed
out) would no longer matter.

Catherine too felt the devastating sting of Henry’s disdain. She tried to
fight back, but in appealing to Henry her words fell on deaf ears, and soon
they fell on no one’s. Isolated from the court, ignored by the king, mad
with anger and frustration, Catherine slowly deteriorated, and finally died
in January of 1536, from a cancerous tumor of the heart.

Interpretation
Vllhen you pay attention to a person, the two of you become partners of
sorts, each moving in step to the actions and reactions of the other. In the
process you lose your initiative. It is a dynamic of all interactions: By ac-
knowledging other people, even if only to fight with them, you open your-
self to their influence. Had Henry locked horns with Catherine, he would
have found himself mired in endless arguments that would have weakened
his resolve and eventually worn him down. (Catherine was a strong, stub-
bom woman.) Had he set out to convince Clement to change his verdict on
the marriages validity, or tried to compromise and negotiate with him, he
would have gotten bogged down in Clement’s favorite tactic: playing for
time, promising flexibility, but actually getting what popes always got-
their way.

Henry would have none of this. He played a devastating power
game——tota.l disdain. By ignoring people you cancel them out. This unset
tles and infuriates them—but since they have no dealings with you, there is
nothing they can do.

This is the offensive aspect of the law. Playing the card of contempt is
immensely powerful, for it lets you determine the conditions of the conflict.
The war is waged on your terms. This is the ultimate power pose: You are
the king, and you ignore what offends you. Watch how this tactic infuriates
people-—half of what they do is to get your attention, and when you with-
hold it from them, they flounder in fmstralzion.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Firstl would like to thank Anna Biller, who helped edit and research this book, and whose in-
valuable insights played a critical role in the shape and content of 17w 48 Laws. Without her,
none of this would have been possible.

I must also thank my dear friend Michiel Schwarz who was responsible for involving me in
the art school Fabrika in Italy and introducing me there to _]oost Elffers, my partner and producer
of The 48 Laws ofPower. It was in the scheming world of Fabrika that _]oost and I saw the timeless-
ness of Machiavelli and from our discussions in Venice, Italy, this book was born.

I would like to thank Henri Le Goubin, who supplied me with many Machiavellian anec~
dotes over the years, particularly conceming the numerous French characters who play such a
large role in this book.

I would also iike to thank Les and Sumiko Biller, who lent me their library on Japanese his-
tory and helped me with the Japanese Tea Ceremony part of the book. Similarly, I must thank
my good friend Elizabeth Yang who advised me on Chinese history.

A book like this depended greatly on the research material available andl am particularly
grateful to the UCLA Research Library; I spent many pleasant days wandering through its in-
comparable collections.

My parents, Laurette and Stanley Green, deserve endless thanks for their patience and

support.

And I must not forget to pay tribute to my cat, Boris, who kept me company throughout the

never—ending days of writing.

Finally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipu~
late, torture, and cause me pain over the years, I bear you no grudges and I thank you for sup
plying me with inspiration for The 48 Laws 0fP0wer.

PREFACE page zrrzii

LAW 1 page I

NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER

Always make those above you feel comfortably superior In your desire to please or impress them, do not go
toofar in displaying your talent: or you might accomplish the oppasite~»—-inspirefear and insecurity. Make
your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights ofpower.

LAW 2 page 8

NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS,
LEARN HOW TO USE ENEMIES

Be wary :.3ffziends——~they will betray you more quickly, for they are easibr aroused to envy.
&#x27;I‘hey also become
spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more
to prove. In fact, you have more to fearfromfriends than fitrm enemies. Ifyou have no enemies, find a way to
make them.

LAW 3 page 16

CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS

Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no
clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide themfar enough down the wrong path, envelop
them in enough smoke, and by the time thrgv realize your intentions, it will be too late.

LAW 4 page 31

ALVVAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY

When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more rommon you appear, and tlw less
in control. Even ifyou are saying something banal, it will seem original ifyou make it vague, open—ended,
and sphinxlike. Powerfltl people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you
are to say somethingfoolish.

LAW 5 /mge37

SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION-—-GUARD IT WITH YOUR LIFE

Reputation is the cornerstone ofpower. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win,&quot; once it slips,
however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be
akrt to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by
opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them.

LAVV 6 page 44

COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST

Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing: Never let yourselfget lost in the
crowd, then, orburied in oblivion. Stand out. He conspicuous, at all cost. Malzeyourselfa magnet ofattention
by appearing larger, more colorful more mysterious than the bland and timid masses.

LAW 7 page 56

GET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS TAKE THE CREDIT
Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own muse. Not only will such assis-
tance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of ejficiertcy and speed. In the end
your hehpers will beforgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourselfwhat others can dofor you.

LAW 8 page 62

MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU—-USE BAIT IF NECESSARY

When you forte the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent
come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him withfabulous gains-then attack. You hold
the cards.

-

LAW’ 9 page 69

WIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT
Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Iyrrhir victory: The resent»
ment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much
more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying :1 word. Demonstrate, do
not explicate.

LAW 1 0 page 76

INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY

You can diefrom someone else’: misery-——emotional states are as infectious as diseases. Km may feel you are
helping the drowning man but you are only precipitatingyour own disaster: The unfortunate sometimes draw
misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy andfortunate instead.

LAW 1 1 page 82

LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU

To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more
freedom you have. Make people depend on youfor their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing tofear.
Never touch them enough so that they can do without you.

LAVV 12 page 89

USE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO DISARM YOUR VICTIM

One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. 0pen~hea7ted gestures of honesty and
gertemsity bring down the guard of even the most suspicions people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in
their armor; you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gzfl-ma ’}i‘q,v&#x27;an horse-——zoill serve the same
purpose.

LAW I 3 page 95

WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE’S SELFAINTEREST,
NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE

Ifyou need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him ofyour past assistance and good deeds. He
willfind a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that
will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion, He will respond enthusiastically when he sees some-
thing to be gainedfor himself.

POSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY
Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead.
Better still: Play the spy yourself In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people
to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity finr artful spying.

LAW J5 page 107

CRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY

All great leaders since Adoses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they
have learned this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, afire will eventu-
ally break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover,
and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.

LAW 16 page 115

USE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR

Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heardfrom, the more common you
appear If you are already established in a group,
temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked
about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.

LAW 17 page 1:23

KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF UNPREDICTABILITY

Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other peoples actions. Your pre-
dictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to
have no consistency orpurpose will keep them off—balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain
your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.

LAW 18 page 130

DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF—ISOLATION IS DANGEROUS

The world is dangerous and memies are everywhere——et/eryone has to protect themselves. A fortres.s seems the
safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you frorn—-—it cuts you offflom valuable in-
formation, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle.
You are shieldedfrom your

by the crowd.

LAW no page 137

KNOW WHO YOU&#x27;RE DEALING WITH—DO NOT OFFEND THE WRONG PERSON

There are many different kinds ofpeople in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to
your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest oftheir lives
seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs’ clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully,
then—
never offend or deceive the wrong person.

DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE

It is thefool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourseh‘. By maintaining
your independence, you become the master of(ufhers—~playingj7eo[1le against one another: making them pursue

LAW 21 page 156

PLAY A SUCKER TO CATCH A SUCKER—--SEEM DUMBER THAN YOUR MARK

No one likesjeeling smpider than the next person. The trick, then, is to make your victimsjeel smart—and not
just smart, out smarter than you are. Once convinced o/&quot;this, they will never suspect that you may have ulte-
rior motives‘

LAW 22 page 163

USE THE SURRENDER TACTIC: TRANSFORM WEAKNESS INTO POWER

When you are weaker; neverfight for honor’s sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to ne-
couer, time to torment and irritate your conqueror; time to waitfor his power to wane. Do not give him the sat»
isfaction offighting and defeating you——surrenderfirst. By turning the other cheek you infiiriate and unsettle
him. Make surrender a tool ofprmren

PLAY ON PEOPLE&#x27;S NEED TO BELIEVE TO CREATE A CULTLIKE FOLLOWING

People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become thefocal point of such desire by ojj‘m&#x27;ng
them a cause, a nemfaith to follow. Keep your wants vague but full ofpromise; emphasize enthusiasm over
rationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your
oehaqf In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold
power.

LAW 28 page 227

ENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS

Ifyou are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execu-
tion, Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are eas»
ily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the léfllid.

LAW 29 page 236

PLAN ALL THE WAY TO THE END

The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles,
and twists offortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end
you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guidefortune and help
determine thefittune by thinkingfar ahead.

LA‘/V 30 page 245

MAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS

Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also
all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act eflortlessly, as zfyou could do much more. Avoid the
temptation of -revealing how hard you wurk—it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be
used against you.

LAW 31 page 25-?

CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU DEAL

The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victimsfeel they are in control,
but are actually your puppets. Give people options that some out in yourfavor whichever one they choose, Force
them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of
a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.

LAW 3 2 page 263

PLAY TO PEOPLES FANTASIES

The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unjbleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are
preparedfor the anger that comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can
manufacture romance or conjure npfarztasy are like oases in the desert: Everyoneflocks to them. There is great
power in tapping into thefantasies of the masses.

DISCOVER EACH MAN&#x27;S THUMBSCREW

Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable
emotion or need; it can also be a smafl secret pleasure. Either may, oncefound, it is a thumbscrew you can turn
to your advantage.

LAW 734 page 252

BE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE

The way you carry yourselfwill often determine how you are treated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or com-
mon will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By
acting regally and confident ofyour powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.

LAVV 33 page 291

MASTER THE ART OF TIMING

Never seem to be in a hurry—hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself: and over time. Always seem pa-
tient, as ifyou know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment;
out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power: Learn to stand back when the time is not yet
ripe, and to strikefiercely when it has reachedfruition.

LAVV 36 page 300

DISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM IS THE BEST REVENGE

By acknowledging a petgr problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy,
the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try tofix it. It
is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it.
&#x27;I7te less interest you reveal,

the more superior you seem.

LAW 37 page3()9

CREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES

Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura ofpower—e1/eryone responds to them. Stage spec-
tacles for those around you,
then, full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence.
Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing.

LAVV 38 page 317

THINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS

Ifyou make a show ofgoing against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways,
people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to
punish youfor making themfeel inferior It isfar safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your
originality onh with tolerantfriends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.

STIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH

Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But ifyou
can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourselfl you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies
off-balance: Find the think in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.

DESPISE THE FREE LUNCH

What is offeredforfree is dangenms—~it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth
is worth payingfor By paying your own way you stay clear ofgratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise
to pay thefull price-—there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and
it cirru-
lating, for g&#x27;enemsity is a sign and a magnetfor power.

LAVV 4] page 347

AVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN&#x27;S SHOES

What happensfirst always appears better and more original than what comes after Ifyou succeed a great man
or have ajarnous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get
lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not ofyour own making: Establish your own name and identity by
changing course. Slay the overbearingfathei; disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own
way.

STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL SCATTER

Trouble can often be traced to a single strong indi-oidual——the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoner of
goodwill. you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the
troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them—thty are irredeemable. Neutralize their in»
jluence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.

LAVV 43 page 367

WORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS

Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to
move in your direction. A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to
operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions,
playing on what they hold dear and what theyfear: Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to
hate you.

DISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT

The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect toolfor deception: When you mirror your enemies, doing ex~
they cannotfigure out your strategy. The Mirror Eflect mocks and humiliates them, making
actly as they do,
them overreact. By holding up a mirror to their psyehes, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their
values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror
Effect.

PREACH THE NEED FOR CHANGE, BUT NEVER REFORM TOO MUCH AT ONCE
Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of
habit. Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. Ifyou are new to a position ofpower, or an
outsider trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is nec-
essary, make itfeel like a gentle improvement on the past.

NEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT
Appearing better than others is always dungwmcs, but most drmgmms of all is to appear to have no fault: or
weaknesses. Envy mates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless
vices, in order to dcflect envy and appear more human and apfiwctchable. Only guds and the dead can seem
pevfect with impunity.

DO NOT G0 PAST THE MARK YOU AIME!) FOR;
IN VICTORY, LEARN WHEN TO STOP
The moment of victory is often tlw mtmmzi ofgmttest peril. In the heat of victory, armganne and 0vmonfi—
dense can push you past the gmzl you had aimedjbr; and by going toofar, you make more enemies than you
defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head. Time is no substétumfor strategy and canrful planning. Set a
goal, and when you mach it, stop.

LAVV 48 page 419

ASSUME. FORMLESSNESS

By talking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking afmm for your
enemy to grasp, keep yoursetfadaptable and on the move. Accept thefaa that nothingis certain and no law is

PREFACE

The feeling of having no power over people and events is generally un-
bearable to us«—-when we feel helpless we feel miserable. No one wants less
power; everyone wants more. In the world today, however, it is dangerous
to seem too power hungry, to be overt with your power moves. We have
to seem fair and decent. So we need to be subtle~—congenial yet cunning,
democratic yet devious.

This game of constant duplicity most resembles the power dynamic
that existed in the scheming world of the old aristocratic court. Throughout
history, a court has always formed itself around the person in power—king,
queen, emperor, leader. The courtiers who filled this court were in an espe-
cially delicate position: They had to serve their masters, but if they seemed
to fawn, if they curried favor too obviously, the other courtiers around
them would notice and would act against them. Attempts to win the mas-
ter’s favor, then, had to be subtle. And even skilled courtiers capable of
such subtlety still had to protect themselves from their fellow courtiers,
who at all moments were scheming to push them aside.

Meanwhile the court was supposed to represent the height of civiliza-
tion and refinement. Violent or overt power moves were frowned upon;
couniers would work silently and secretly against any among them who
used force. This was the couxtier’s dilemma: While appearing the very
paragon of elegance, they had to outwit and thwart their own opponents in
the subtlest of ways. The successful comtier learned over time to make all
of his moves indirect; if he stabbed an opponent in the back, it was with a
velvet glove on his hand and the sweetest of smiles on his face. Instead of
the perfect courtier got his way
using coercion or outright treachery,
through seduction, charm, deception, and subtle strategy, always planning
several moves ahead. Life in the court was a never-ending game that re-
quired constant vigilance and tactical thinking. It was civilized war.

Today we face a peculiarly similar paradox to that of the courtier:
Everything must appear civilized, decent, democratic, and fair. But if we
play by those rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed
by those around us who are not so foolish. As the great Renaissance diplo-
mat and courtier Niccolo Machiavelli wrote, “Any man who tries to be
good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who
are not good.” The court imagined itself the pinnacle of refinement, but un-

derneath its glittering surface a cauldron of dark emotions--greed, envy,
lust, hatred-—boi1ed and simmered. Our world today similarly imagines it-
self the pinnacle of fairness, yet the same ugly emotions still stir within us,
as they have forever. The game is the same. Outwardly, you must seem to
respect the niceties, but inwardly, unless you are a fool, you learn quickly
to be prudent, and to do as Napoleon advised: Place your iron hand inside
a. velvet glove. If, like the courtier of times gone by, you can master the arts
of indirection, learning to seduce, charm, deceive, and subtly outmaneuver
your opponents, you will attain the heights of power. You will be able to
make people bend to your will without their realizing what you have done.
And if they do not realize what you have done, they will neither resent not
resist you.

To some people the notion of consciously playing power games—no mat-
ter how indii-ect—seems evil, asocial, a relic of the past. They believe they
can opt out of the game by behaving in ways that have nothing to do with
power. You must beware of such people, for while they express such opin~
ions outwardly, they are often among the most adept players at power.
They utilize strategies that cleverly disguise the nature of the manipulation
involved. These types, for example, will often display their weakness and
lack of power as a kind of moral virtue. But true powerlessness, without
any motive of selfiinterest, would not publicize its weakness to gain sympa-
thy or respect. Making a show of one’s weakness is actually a very effective
strategy, subtle and deceptive, in the game of power (see Law 22, the Sur—
render Tactic).

Another strategy of the supposed nonplayer is to demand equality in
every area of life. Everyone must be treated alike, whatever their status and
to avoid the taint of power, you attempt to treat everyone
strength. But
equally and fairly, you will confront the problem that some people do cer-
tain things better than others. Treating everyone equally means ignoring
their differences, elevating the less skillful and suppressing those who
excel. Again, many of those who behave this way are actually deploying
another power strategy, redistributing people’s rewards in a way that they
determine.

Yet another way of avoiding the game would be perfect honesty and
straightforwardness, since one of the main techniques of those who seek
power is deceit and secrecy. But being perfectly honest will inevitably hurt
and insult a great many people, some of whom will choose to injure you in
return. No one will see your honest statement as completely objective and
free of some personal motivation. And they will be right: In truth, the use
of honesty is indeed a power strategy, intended to convince people of one’s
noble, goodehearted, selfless character. It is a form of persuasion, even a
subtle form of coercion.

Finally, those who claim to be nonplayers may affect an air of naiveté,
to protect them from the accusation that they are after power. Beware
again, however, for the appearance of naiveté can be an effective means of

PREFACE

deceit (see Law 21, Seem Dumber Than Your Mark). And even genuine
naiveté is not free of the snares of power. Children may be naive in many
ways, but they often act from an elemental need to gain control over those
around them. Children suffer greatly from feeling powerless in the adult
world, and they use any means available to get their way. Genuinely inno-
cent people may still be playing for power, and are often horribly effective
at the game, since they are not hindered by reflection. Once again, those
who make a show or display of innocence are the least innocent of all.

You can recognize these supposed nonplayers by the way they flaunt
their moral qualities, their piety, their exquisite sense of justice. But since
all of us hunger for power, and almost all of our actions are aimed at gain-
ing it, the nonplayers are merely throwing dust in our eyes, distracting us
from their power plays with their air of moral superiority. If you observe
them closely, you will see in fact that they are often the ones most skillful at
indirect manipuiation, even if some of them practice it unconsciously. And
they greatly resent any publicizing of the tactics they use every day.

If the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it,
there is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you
powerless, and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of strug-
gling against the inevitable, instead of arguing and whining and feeling
guilty, it is far better to excel at power. In fact, the better you are at dealing
with power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you be
come. By following the route of the perfect courtier (see Law 24) you learn
to make others feel better about themselves, becoming a source of pleasure
to them. They will grow dependent on your abilities and desirous of your
presence. By mastering the 48 laws in this book, you spare others the pain
that comes from bungling with power—~by playing with fire without know-
ing its properties. If the game of power is inescapable, better to be an artist
than 2. denier or a bungler.

Learning the game of power requires a certain way of looking at the world,
a shifting of perspective. It takes effort and years of practice, for much of
the game may not come naturally. Certain basic skills are required, and
once you master these skills you will be able to apply the laws of power
more easily.

The most important of these skills, and power’s crucial foundation, is
the ability to master your emotions. An emotional response to a. situation is
the single greatest barrier to power, a mistake that will cost you a lot more
than any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing your feel-
ings. Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly,
you cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of control.

Anger is the most destructive of emotional responses, for it clouds
your vision the most. It also has a ripple effect that invariably makes situa-
tions less controllable and heightens your enemy’s resolve. If you are try»
ing to destroy an enemy who has hurt you, far better to keep him off—guard
by feigning friendliness than showing your anger.

l

Pl-RE FACE

rile

Love and affection are also potentially destructive, in that they blind
you to the often self-serving interests of those whom you least suspect of
playing a power game. You cannot repress anger or love, or avoid feeling
them, and you should not try. But you should be careful about how you ex-
press them, and most important, they should never influence your plans
and strategies in any way.

Related to mastering your emotions is the ability to distance yourself
from the present moment and think objectively about the past and future.
Like Janus, the double—faced Roman deity and guardian of all gates and
doorways, you must be able to look in both directions at once, the better to
handle danger from wherever it comes. Such is the face you must create for
yourself-one face looking continuously to the future and the other to the
P

ast.

For the future, the motto is, “No days unalert.” Nothing should catch
you by surprise because you are constantly imagining problems before
they arise. Instead of spending your time dreaming of your plan’s happy
ending, you must work on calculating every possible permutation and pit-
fall that might emerge in it. The further you see, the more steps ahead you
plan, the more powerful you become.

The other face ofJanus looks constantly to the past—though not to re-
member past hurts or bear grudges. That would only curb your power.
Half of the game is learning how to forget those events in the past that eat
away at you and cloud your reason. The real purpose of the backward-
glancing eye is to educate yourself constantly—you look at the past to learn
from those who came before you. (The many historical examples in this
book will greatly help that process.) Then, having looked to the past, you
look closer at hand, to your own actions and those of your friends. This is
the most vital school you can learn from, because it comes from personal
experience.

You begin by examining the mistakes you have made in the past, the
ones that have most grievously held you back. You analyze them in terms
of the 48 laws of power, and you extract from them a lesson and an oath:
“I shall never repeat such a mistake; I shall never fall
into such a trap
again.” If you can evaluate and observe yourself in this way, you can learn
to break the patterns of the past—an immensely valuable skill.

Power requires the ability to play with appearances. To this end you
must learn to wear many masks and keep a bag full of deceptive tricks. De-
ception and masquerade should not be seen as ugly or immoral. All human
interaction requires deception on many levels, and in some ways what sep—
arates humans from animals is our ability to lie and deceive. In Greek
myths, in India’s Mahabharata cycle, in the Middle Eastern epic of Gilga~
mesh, it is the privilege of the gods to use deceptive arts; a great man,
Odysseus for instance, was judged by his ability to rival the craftiness of the
gods, stealing some of their divine power by matching them in wits and de-
ception. Deception is a developed art of civilization and the most potent
weapon in the game of power.

;&#x27; PREFACE

You cannot succeed at deception unless you take a somewhat dis-
tanced approach to yourself——-unless you can be many different people,
wearing the mask that the day and the moment require. With such a flexi«
ble approach to all appearances, including your own, you lose a lot of the
inward heaviness that holds people down. Make your face as malleable as
the actor’s, work to conceal your intentions from others, practice luring
people into traps. Playing with appearances and mastering arts of decep
tion are among the aesthetic pleasures of life. They are also key compo«
nents in the acquisition of power.

If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience
in all things is your crucial shield. Patience will protect you from making
moronic blunders, Like mastering your emotions, patience is :1 skill-—it
does not come naturally. But nothing about power is natural; power is
more godlike than anything in the natural world. And patience is the
supreme virtue of the gods, who have nothing but time. Everything good
will happen——-the grass will grow again, if you give it time and see several
steps into the future. Impatience, on the other hand, only makes you look
weak. It is a. principal impediment to power.

Power is essentially amoral and one of the most important skills to ac~
quire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil. Power is a
game—-this cannot be repeated too often—and in games you do not judge
your opponents by their intentions but by the effect of their actions. You
measure their strategy and their power by what you can see and feel. How
often are someone’s intentions made the issue only to cloud and deceive!
What does it matter if another player, your friend or rival, intended good
things and had only your interests at heart, if the effects of his action lead to
so much min and confusion? It is only natural for people to cover up their
actions with all kinds ofjustifications, always assuming that they have acted
out of goodness. You must learn to inwardly laugh each time you hear this
and never get caught up in gauging someone’s intentions and actions
through a set of moral judgments that are really an excuse for the accumu-
lation of power.

It is a game. Your opponent sits opposite you. Both of you behave as
gentlemen or ladies, observing the rules of the game and taking nothing
personally. You play with a strategy and you observe your opponent’s
moves with as much calmness as you can muster. In the end, you will ap-
preciate the politeness of those you are playing with more than their good
and sweet intentions. Train your eye to follow the results of their moves,
the outward circumstances, and do not be distracted by anything else.

Half of your mastery of power comes from what you do not do, what
you do not allow yourself to get dragged into. For this skill you must learn
to judge all things by what they cost you. As Nietzsche wrote, “The value of
a thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays l
for it——what it costs us.” Perhaps you will attain your goal, and a worthy goal
at that, but at what price? Apply this standard to everything, including
whether to collaborate with other people or come to their aid. In the end,

life is short, opportunities are few, and you have only so much energy to
draw on. And in this sense time is as important a consideration as any
other. Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of
others—that is too high a price to pay.

Power is a social game. To learn and master it, you must develop the
ability to study and understand people. As the great seventeenth-century
thinker and courtier Baltasar Gracién wrote: “Many people spend time
studying the properties of animals or herbs; how much more important it
would be to study those of people, with whom we must live or die!” To be a
master player you must also be a master psychologist. You must recognize
motivations and see through the cloud of dust with which people surround
their actions. An understanding of people’s hidden motives is the single
greatest piece of knowledge you can have in acquiring power. It opens up
endless possibilities of deception, seduction, and manipulation.

People are of infinite complexity and you can spend a lifetime watch-
ing them without ever fully understanding them. So it is all the more im-
portant, then, to begin your education now. In doing so you must also keep
one principle in mind: Never discriminate as to whom you study and
whom you trust. Never trust anyone completely and study everyone, in-
cluding friends and loved ones.

Finally, you must learn always to take the indirect route to power. Dis-
guise your cunning. Like a billiard ball that caroms several times before it
hits its target, your moves must be planned and developed in the least ob
vious way. By training yourself to be indirect, you can thrive in the modern
court, appearing the paragon of decency while being the consummate ma-
nipulator.

r“&#x27;&quot;“”‘fi

Consider The 48 Laws ofPower a kind of handbook on the arts of indirec»
tion. The laws are based on the writings of men and women who have
studied and mastered the game of power. These writings span a period of
more than three thousand years and were created in civilizations as dis»
parate as ancient China and Renaissance Italy; yet they share common
threads and themes, together hinting at an essence of power that has yet to
be fully articulated. The 48 laws of power are the distillation of this accu-
mulated wisdom, gathered from the writings of the most illustrious strate
gists (Sun-tzu, Clausewitz), statesmen (Bismarck, Talleyrand), courtiers
(Castiglione, Gracién), seducers (Ninon de Lenclos, Casanova), and con
artists (“Yellow Kid” Weil) in history.

The laws have a simple premise: Certain actions almost always in-
crease one’s power (the observance of the law), while others decrease it
and even ruin us (the transgression of the law). These transgressions and
observances are illustrated by historical examples. The laws are timeless
and definitive.

T7ze 48 Laws ofPower can be used in several ways. By reading the book
straight through you can learn about power in general. Although several of
the laws may seem not to pertain directly to your life, in time you will

xxii

PREFACE

probably find that all of them have some application, and that in fact they
are interrelated. By getting an overview of the entire subject you will best
be able to evaluate your own past actions and gain a greater degree of con-
trol over your immediate affairs. A thorough reading of the book will in»
spire thinking and reevaluation long after you finish it.

The book has also been designed for browsing and for examining the
law that seems at that particular moment most pertinent to you. Say you
are experiencing problems with a superior and cannot understand why
your efforts have not lead to more gratitude or a promotion. Several laws
specifically address the master-underling relationship, and you are almost
certainly transgressing one of them. By browsing the initial paragraphs for
the 48 laws in the table of contents, you can identify the pertinent law.

Finally, the book can be browsed through and picked apart for enter-
tainrnent. for an enjoyable ride through the foibles and great deeds of our
predecessors in power. A warning, however, to those who use the book for
this purpose: It might be better to tum back. Power is endlessly seductive
and deceptive in its own way. It is a 1abyrinth—your mind becomes con-
sumed with solving ifs infinite problems, and you soon realize how pleas-
antly lost you have become. In other words, it becomes most amusing by
taking it seriously. Do not be frivolous with such a critical matter. The gods
of power frown on the frivolous; they give ultimate satisfaction only to
those who study and reflect, and punish those who skim the surfaces look-
ing for a good time.

Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin
among the great number who are not good. Hence :2 prince who wants
to keep his authority must [mm how not to be good, and use that

TRANSCRESSION OF THE LAW
Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV’s finance minister in the first years of his reign,
was a generous man who loved lavish parties, pretty women, and poetry.
He also loved money, for he led an extravagant lifestyle. Fouquet was
clever and very much indispensable to the king, so when the prime mim&#x27;s—
the finance minister expected to be
ter, Jules Mazarin, died,
named the successor. Instead, the king decided to abolish the position. This
and other signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favor, and
so he decided to ingraliate himself with the king by staging the most spec-
tacular party the world had ever seen. The party’s ostensible purpose
would be to commemorate the completion of Fouquet’s chateau, Vaux—le-
Vicomte, but its real function was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of
honor.

in 1661,

The most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest minds
of the Iime—La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sévigné—
attended the party. Moliere wrote a play for the occasion, in which he
himself was to perform at the evening’s conclusion. The party began with a
lavish seven—course dinner,
featuring foods from the Orient never be-
fore tasted in France, as well as new dishes created especially for the night.
The meal was accompanied with music commissioned by Fouquet
to
honor the king.

After dinner there was a promenade through the chateau’s gardens.
The grounds and fountains of Vaux—le»Vicomte were to be the inspiration
for Versailles.

Fouquet personally accompanied the young king through the geomet-
rically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds. Arriving at the
gardens’ canals, they witnessed a fireworks display, which was followed by
the performance of Moliere’s play. The party ran well into the night and
everyone agreed it was the most amazing affair they had ever attended.

The next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king’s head musketeer,
D’Artagna.n. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the
country’s treasury. (Actually, most of the stealing he was accused of he had
done on the kings behalf and with the king’s permission.) Fouquet was
found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the
Pyrenees Mountains, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in soli-
tary confinement.

Interpretation
Louis XIV, the Sun King, was a proud and arrogant man who wanted to be
the center of attention at all times; he could not countenance being out-
done in lavishness by anyone, and certainly not his finance minister. To
succeed Fouquet, Louis chose _]ean—Baptiste Colbert, a man famous for his
parsimony and for giving the dullest parties in Paris. Colbert made sure
that any money liberated from the treasury went straight into Louis’s
hands. With the money, Louis built a palace even more magnificent than
Fouquet’s—the glorious palace of Versailles. He used the same architects,

9

LAW 1

decorators, and garden designer. And at Versailles, Louis hosted parties
even more extravagant than the one that cost Fouquet his freedom.

Let us examine the situation. The evening of the party, as Fouquet pre-
sented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each more magnificent than the one
before, he imagined the affair as demonstrating his loyalty and devotion to
the king. Not only did he think the party would put him back in the king’s
favor, he thought it would show his good taste, his connections, and his
popularity, making him indispensable to the king and demonstrating that
he would make an excellent prime minister. Instead, however, each new
spectacle, each appreciative smile bestowed by the guests on Fouquet,
made it seem to Louis that his own friends and subjects were more
charmed by the finance minister than by the king himself, and that Fouquet
was actually flauming his wealth and power. Rather than flattering Louis
XXV, Fouquet’s elaborate party offended the king’s vanity. Louis would not
admit this to anyone, of course-—-instead, he found a convenient excuse to
rid himself of a man who had inadvertently made him feel insecure.

Such is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who unbalance the
master’s sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make him doubt his pro
eminence.

When the wming began, Fouquet was at the to}: of the world.
By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom.
Voltaire, 16.944 778

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the early 1600s,
the Italian astronomer and mathematician Galileo
found himself in a precarious position. He depended on the generosity of
great rulers to support his research, and so, like all Renaissance scientists,
he would sometimes make gifts of his inventions and discoveries to the
leading patrons of the time. Once, for instance, he presented a militaiy
compass he had invented to the Duke of Gonzaga. Then he dedicated a
book explaining the use of the compass to the Medicis. Both rulers were
grateful, and through them Galileo was able to find more students to teach.
No matter how great the discovery, however, his patrons usually paid him
with gifts, not cash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and depen-
dence. There must be an easier way, he thought.

Galileo hit on a new strategy in l6l0, when he discovered the moons
of Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his patrons—giving
one the telescope he had used, dedicating a book to another, and so on—as
he had done in the past, he decided to focus exclusively on the Medicis. He
chose the Medicis for one reason: Shortly after Cosimo I had established
the Medici dynasty, in 1540, he had made Jupiter, the mightiest of the
gods, the Medici symbol—a symbol of a. power that went beyond politics
and banking, one linked to ancient Rome and its divinities.

Galileo turned his discovery of _]upiter’s moons into a cosmic event

LAW 1 33

honoring the Medicis’ greatness. Shortly after the discovery, he announced
that “the bright stars [the moons ofjupiterl offered themselves in the heav~
ens” to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo II’s enthronement. He
said that the number of the moons-—-four——harmonized with the number of
the Medicis (Cosimo II had three brothers) and that the moons orbitecl
Jupiter as these four sons revolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty’ s founder.
More than coincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected
the ascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to
the Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representing Jupiter sitting
on a cloud with the four stars circling about him, and presented this to
Cosimo II as a symbol of his link to the stars.

In 1610 Cosimo II made Galileo his official court philosopher and
mathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a life»
time. The days of begging for patronage were over.

Interpretation
In one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he had in
years of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to appear more
brilliant than other people.

They do not care about science or empirical tmth or the latest inven~
tion; they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the Medicis
infinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces them he had
by making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget or discovery.

Scientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage. They
too must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their great intellec-
tual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he were only there to
supply the funds~—an ugly, ignoble job. The producer of a great work
wants to feel he is more than just the provider of the financing. He wants to
appear creative and powerful, and also more important than the work pro~
duoed in his name. Instead of insecurity you must give him glory. Galileo
did not challenge the intellectual authority of the Medicis with his discov~
ery, or make them feel inferior in any way; by literally aligning them with
the stars, he made them shine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He did
not outshine the master, he made the master outshine all others.

KEYS TO POWER
Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and dis-
play your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment, envy, and
other manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend
your life worrying about the petty feelings of others. With those above you,
however, you must take a different approach: When it comes to power,
outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all.

Do not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the
days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high standing in life
are like kings and queens: They want to feel secure in their positions, and

superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a. deadly
but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting
your gifts and talents, you are winning the master’s affection. He may feign
appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone
less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced
the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will
not admit the tmth, but will find an excuse to rid himself of your presence.
This Law involves two rules that you must realize, First, you can inad-
vertently outshine a master simply by being yourself. There are masters
who are more insecure than others, nronstrously insecure; you may natu-
rally outshine them by your charm and grace.

No one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of
Faenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he captivated
his subjects with his generosity and open spirit.

In the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the city
surrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia, who,
however, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its fortress, exe-
cuted none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteen at the
time, to remain with his court, in complete freedom.

A few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi away to a
Roman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of the River
Tiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the horrible deed with
some sort of tmmped~up charge of treason and conspiracy, but the real
problem was that he was notoriously vain and insecure. The young man
was outshining him without even trying. Given Manfredi’s natural talents,
the prince’s mere presence made Borgia seem less attractive and charis-
matic. The lesson is simple: If you cannot help being charming and supe~
not, you must learn to avoid sud: monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a
way to mute your good qualities when in the company of a Cesare Borgia.
Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do
anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell
out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine. In
late-sixteentbcenturyjapan, the favorite of Emperor Hideyoshi was a man
called Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the tea ceremony, which had be-
come an obsession with the nobility, he was one of Hideyoshi’s most
trusted advisers, had his own apartment in the palace, and was honored
throughout japan. Yet in 1591, Hideyoshi had him arrested and sentenced
to death. Rikyu took his own life, instead. The cause for his sudden change
of fortune was discovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and
later court favorite, had had a wooden statue made of himself wearing san-
dals (a Sign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in
the most important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the roy-
alty who often would pass by. To Hidcyoshi this signified that Rikyu had
no sense of limits. Presurning that he had the same rights as those of the
highest nobility, he had forgotten that his position depended on the em»
peror, and had come to believe that he had earned it on his own. This was

LAW 1

an unforgivable miscalculation of his own importance and he paid for it
with his life. Remember the following: Never take your position for
granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head.

Knowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn this Law
to your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master. Overt
flattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and
looks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much more powerful. If
you are more intelligent than your master, for example, seem the opposite:
Make him appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that
you need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in
the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore
such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the
of his experi-
ence may direct rancor and ill will at you instead.

If your ideas are more creative than your master’s, ascribe them to
him, in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice is
merely an echo of his advice.

If you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the court
jester, but do not make him appear cold and surly by comparison. Tone
down your humor if necessary, and find ways to make him seem the dis-
penser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more sociable
and generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud that blocks
his radiance from others. He must appear as the sun around which every-
one revolves, radiating power and brilliance, the center of attention. If you
are thrust into the position of entertaining him, a display of your limited
means may win you his sympathy. Any attempt to impress him with your
grace and generosity can prove fatal: Learn from Fouquet or pay the price.
In all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if
in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain
in control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity. This will all come in
handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo,
you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you
are a godsend and you will be instantly promoted.

LAW 1

Authority: Avoid outsliining the master. All superiority is odious, but the
superiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it. is fatal. This is a
lesson that the stars in the sky Leach us-—--they may be related to the sun,
and just as brilliant, but

they never appear in her company.

REVERSAI.
You cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across, but you
must be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing
to fear from outshining him. Do not be merciful-—-your master had no such
scruples in his own cold—blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he
is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall: Outclo, outchann, outsmart him at
key moments. If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course.
Do not risk outshining a feeble superior--it might appear cruel or spiteful.
But if your master is firm in his position, yet you know yourself to be the
more capable, hide your time and be patient. It is the natural course of
things that power eventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall
someday, and if you play it right, you will outlive and someday outshine
him.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In the mid—ninth century A.l.)., a young man named Michael III assumed
the throne of the Byzantine Empire. His mother, the Empress Theodora,
had been banished to a nunnery, and her lover, Theoctistus, had been mur-
dered; at the head of the conspiracy to depose Theodora and enthrone
Michael had been Michael’s uncle, Bardas, a man of intelligence and a:mbi~
tion. Michael was now a young, inexperienced ruler, surrounded by in»

someone he could trust as his councillor, and his thoughts turned to Basil~
ius, his best friend. Basilius had no experience whatsoever in government
and politics——-in fact, he was the head of the royal stables——buI he had
proven his love and gratitude time and again.

They had met a few years before, when Michael had been visiting the
stables just as a wild horse got loose. Basilius, a. young groom from peasant
Macedonian stock, had saved Michael’s life. The gmom’s strength and
courage had impressed Michael, who immediately raised Basilius from the
obscurity of being a horse trainer to the position of head of the stables. He
loaded his friend with gifts and favors and they became inseparable. Basil-
ius was sent to the finest school in Byzantium, and the crude peasant be—
came a cultured and sophisticated courtier.

Now Michael was emperor, and in need of someone loyal. Who could
he better trust with the post of chamberlain and chief councillor than a
young man who owed him everything?

Basilius could be trained for the job and Michael loved him like a
brother. Ignoring the advice of those who recommended the much more
qualified Bardas, Michael chose his friend.

Basilius learned well and was soon advising the emperor on all matters
of state. The only problem seemed to be money-——Basilius never had
enough. Exposure to the splendor of Byzantine court life made him avari-
cious for the perks of power. Michael doubled, then tripled his salary, en-
nobled him, and married him off to his own mistress, Eudoxia Ingerina.
Keeping such a trusted friend and adviser satisfied was worth any price.
But more trouble was to come. Bardas was now head of the army, and
Basilius convinced Michael mat the man was hopelessly ambitious. Under
the illusion that he could control his nephew, Bardas had conspired to put
him on the throne, and he could conspire again, this time to get rid of
Michael and assume the crown himself. Basilius poured poison into
Michael’s ear until the emperor agreed to have his uncle murdered. During
a great horse race, Basilius closed in on Bardas in the crowd and stabbed
him to death. Soon after, Basilius asked that he replace Bardas as head of
the army, where he could keep control of the realm and quell rebellion.
This was granted.

Now Basilius’s power and wealth only grew, and a few years later
Michael, in financial straits from his own extravagance, asked him to pay
back some of the money he had borrowed over the years. To Michael’s
shock and astonishment, Basilius refused, with a look of such impudence

that the emperor suddenly realized his predicament: The former stable
boy had more money, more allies in the army and senate, and in the end
more power than the emperor himself. A few weeks later, after a night of
heavy drinking, Michael awoke to find himself surrounded by soldiers.
Basilius watched as they stabbed the emperor to death. Then, after pro-
claiming himself emperor, he rode his horse through the streets of Byzan-
tium, brandishing the head of his former benefactor and best friend at the
end of a long pike.

Interpretation
Michael III staked his future on the sense of gratitude he thought Basilius
must feel for him. Surely Basilius would serve him best; he owed the em-
peror his wealth, his education, and his position. Then, once Basilius was in
power, anything he needed it was best to give to him, strengthening the
bonds between the two men. It was only on the fateful day when the em-
peror saw that impudent smile on Basilius’s face that he realized his deadly
mistake.

He had created a monster. He had allowed a man to see power up
close-—a man who then wanted more, who asked for anything and got it,
who felt encumbered by the charity he had received and simply did what
many people do in such a situation: They forget the favors they have re-
ceived and imagine they have earned their success by their own merits.

At Michael’s moment of realization, he could still have saved his own
life, but friendship and love blind every man to their interests. Nobody be—
Iieves a friend can betray. And Michael went on disbelieving until the day
his head ended up on a pike.

Lord, protect mefrum my friends; I can take care qf my enemies.
Volmlre, 1694-1778

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
For several centuries after the fall of the Han Dynasty {A.D. 222}, Chinese his-
tory followed the same pattern of violent and bloody coups, one after the
other. Army men would plot to kill a weak emperor, then would replace him
on the Dragon Throne with a strong general. The general would start a new
dynasty and crown himself emperor; to ensure his own survival he would kill
off his fellow generals. A few years later, however, the pattern would resume:
New generals would rise up and assassinate him or his sons in their turn. To
be emperor of China was to be alone, surrounded by a pack of enemies—it
was the least powerful, least secure position in the realm.

In A.D. 959, General Chao K’uang—yin became Emperor Sung. He
knew the adds, the probability that within a year or two he would be mur-
dered; how could he break the pattern? Soon after becoming emperor,
Sung ordered a banquet to celebrate the new dynasty, and invited the most
powerful commanders in the army. After they had drunk much wine, he

AFRICAN /-‘oz./4 1;: LE

dismissed the guards and everybody else except the generals, who now
feared he would murder them in one fell swoop. Instead, he addressed
them: “The whole day is spent in fear, and I am unhappy both at the table
and in my bed. For which one of you does not dream of ascending the
throne? I do not doubt your allegiance, but if by some chance your subor-
dinates, seeking wealth and position, were to force the emperor’s yellow
robe upon you in turn, how could you refuse it?” Drunk and tearing for
their lives, the generals proclaimed their innocence and their loyalty. But
Sung had other ideas: “The best way to pass one’s days is in peaceful en~
joyment of riches and honor. If you are willing to give up your commands,
I am ready to provide you with line estates and beautiful dwellings where
you may take your pleasure with singers and girls as your companions.”

The astonished generals realized that instead of a life of anxiety and
struggle Sung was offering them riches and security. The next day, all of
the generals tendered their resignations, and they retired as nobles to the
estates that Sung bestowed on them.

In one stroke, Sung turned a pack of “friendly” wolves, who would
likely have betrayed him, into a group of docile lambs, fax from all power.
Over the next few years Sung continued his campaign to secure his
rule. In A.D. 971, King Lin of the Southern Han finally surrendered to him
after years of rebellion. To Liu’s astonishment, Sung gave him a rank in the
imperial court and invited him to the palace to seal their newfound friend-
ship with wine. As King Liu took the glass that Sung offered him, he hesi-
tated, fearing it contained poison. “Your subject’s crimes certainly merit
death,” he cried out, “but I beg Your Majesty to spare your subject’s life. In-
deed I dare not drink this wine.” Emperor Sung laughed, took the glass
from Lin, and swallowed it himself. There was no poison. From then on
Liu became his most trusted and loyal friend.

At the time, China had splintered into many smaller kingdoms. When
Ch’ien Shu, the king of one of these, was defeated, Sung’s ministers ad-
vised the emperor to lock this rebel up. They presented documents prov-
ing that he was still conspiring to kill Sung. When Ch’ien Shu came to visit
the emperor, however, instead of locking him up, Sung honored him. He
also gave him a package, which he told the former king to open when he
was halfway home. Ch’ien Shu opened the bundle on his return journey
and saw that it contained all the papers documenting his conspiracy. He re-
alized that Sung knew of his murderous plans, yet had spared him nonethe-
less. This generosity won him over, and he too became one of Sung’s most
loyal vassals.

Interpretation
A Chinese proverb compares friends to the jaws and teeth of a dangerous
animal: If you are not careful, you will find them chewing you up. Emperor
Sung knew the jaws he was passing between when he assumed the throne:
His “friends” in the army would chew him up like meat, and if he some-
how survived, his “friends” in the government would have him for supper.

Emperor Sung would have no truck with “friends”—-he bribed his fellow
generals with splendid estates and kept them far away. This was a much
better way to emasculate them than killing them, which would only have
led other generals to seek vengeance. And Sung would have nothing to do
with “friendly” ministers. More often than not, they would end up drinking
his famous cup of poisoned wine.

Instead of relying on friends, Sung used his enemies, one after the
other, transforming them into far more reliable subjects. While a friend ex-
pects more and more favors, and seethes with jealousy, these former £:ne~
mies expected nothing and got everything. A man suddenly spared the
guillotine is a grateful man indeed, and will go to the ends of the earth for
the man who has pardoned him. In time, these former enemies became
Sung’ s most trusted friends.

And Sung was finally able to break the pattern of coups, violence, and
civil war—the Sung Dynasty ruled China for more than three hundred
years.

KEYS TO POWER
It is natural to want to employ your friends when you find yourself in times
of need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends soften the harshness.
Besides, you know them. ‘Why depend on a stronger when you have a
friend at hand?

The problem is that you often do not know your friends as well as you
imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument.
They cover up their unpleasant qualifies so as to not offend each other.
They laugh extra hard at each other’s jokes. Since honesty rarely strength-
ens friendship, you may never know how a friend tmly feels. Friends will
say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in
clothes———maybe they mean it, often they do not.

When you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualities
he or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of kindness that
unbalances everything. People want to feel they deserve their good for-
tune. The receipt of a favor can become oppressive: It means you have
been chosen because you are a friend, not necessarily because you are do
serving. There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring
friends that secretly afflicts them. The injury will come out slowly: A little
more honesty, flashes of resentment and envy here and there, and before
you know it your friendship fades. The more favors and gifts you supply to
revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive.

Ingratitude has along and deep history. It has demonstrated its powers

1.‘)

LAW 2

for so many centuries, that it is truly amazing that people continue to un
derestimate them. Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude from a
friend, you will be pleasantly surprised when they do prove grateful.

The problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably limit
your power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help you; and
in the end, skill and competence are far more important than friendly feel-
ings. (Michael Ill had a man right under his nose who would have steered
him right and kept him alive: That man was Bardas.)

All working situations require a kind of distance between people. You
are trying to work, not make friends; friendliness (real or false) only ob
scores that fact. The key to power, then, is the ability to judge who is best
able to further your interests in all situations. Keep friends for friendship,
but work with the skilled and competent.

Your enemies, on the other hand, are an untapped gold mine that you
must learn to exploit. When Talleyrancl, Napc-leon’s foreign minister, de-
cided in 1807 that his boss was leading France to ruin, and the time had
come to turn against him, he understood the dangers of conspiring against
the emperor; he needed a partner, a confederate-——-what friend could he
trust in such a project? He chose Joseph Fouché, head of the secret police,
his most hated enemy, a man who had even tried to have him assassinated.
He knew that their former hatred would create an opportunity for an emo~
tional reconciliation. He knew that Fouché would expect nothing from
him, and in fact would work to prove that he was worthy of Talleyra.nd’s
choice; a person who has something to prove will move mountains for you.
Finally, he knew that his relationship with Fouché would be based on mu-
tual selfiinterest, and would not be contaminated by personal feeling. The
selection proved perfect; although the conspirators did not succeed in top-
pling Napoleon, the union of such powerful but unlikely partners gener-
ated much interest in the cause; opposition to the emperor slowly began to
spread. And from then on, Talleyi-and and Fouché had a. fruitful working
relationship. Whenever you can, bury the hatchet with an enemy, and
make a point of putting him in your service.

V

As Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend of
him. In 1971, during the Vietnam War, Henry Kissinger was the target of
an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt, a conspiracy involving, among others,
the renowned antiwar activist priests the Berrigan brothers, four more
Catholic priests, and four nuns. In private, without informing the Secret
Service or the justice Department, Kissinger arranged a Saturday-morning
meeting with three of the alleged kidnappers. Explaining to his guests that
he would have most American soldiers out of Vietnam by mid-1972, he
completely charmed them. They gave him some “Kidnap Kissinger” but»
tons and one of them remained a friend of his for years, visiting him on
several occasions. This was not just 8. onetime ploy: Kissinger made a pol-
icy of working with those who disagreed with him. Colleagues commented
that he seemed to get along better with his enemies than with his friends.

then, to use enemies as enemies rather than transforming them into friends
or allies.

Mao Tse-tung saw conflict as key in his approach to power. In 1937 the
Japanese invaded China, i.nte.rrupi:i:ug the aim‘! war between Mods Com-
munists and their enemy, the Nationalists.

Fearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist
leaders advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and using
the time to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not possibly
defeat and occupy a vast country like China for long. Once they left, the
Communists would have grown rusty if they had been out of combat for
several years, and would be ill prepared to reopen their struggle with the
Nationalists. To fight a formidable foe like the Japanese, in fact, would be
the perfect training for the Communists’ ragtag army. Mao’s plan was
adopted, and it worked: By the time the Japanese finally retreated, the
Communists had gained the fighting experience that helped them defeat
the Nationalists.

Years later, aJapanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his coun-
try’s invasion of China. Mao interrupted, “Should I not thank you in»
stead?” Without a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group cannot
grow stronger.

Mao’s strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First,
be certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a
fight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the
Japanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent ene-
mies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even turning a friend
into an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use
such enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing
it as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged Chi.na’s dis
agreements with the Soviet Union and the United States; without clear-cut
enemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese
Communism meant A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument
for your side than all the words you could possibly put together.

Never let the presence of enemies upset or distress you—you are far
better off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your
real enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to
enhance his reputation as a surefoobed fighter who can be relied upon in
times of uncertainty.

REVE RSA L
Although it is generally best not to mix work with friendship, there are
times when a friend can be used to greater effect than an enemy. A man of
power, for example, often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the
sake of appearances it is generally preferable to have other people do it for
him; friends often do this the best, since their afiection for him makes them
willing to take chances. Also, if your plans go awry for some reason, you
can use a friend as a convenient scapegoat. This “fall of the favorite” was a
trick often used by kings and sovereigns: They would let their closest friend
at court take the fall for a mistake, since the public would not believe that
they would deliberately sacrifice a friend for such a purpose. Of course,
after you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best, then, to
reserve the scapegoat role for someone who is close to you but not too
close.

Finally, the problem about working with friends is that it confuses the
boundaries and distances that working requires. But if both partners in the
arrangement understand the dangers involved, a friend often can be em-
ployed to great effect. You must never let your guard down in such a ven-
ture, however; always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional
disturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing is stable in the realm of
power, and even the closest of friends can be transformed into the worst of
enernies.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Over several weeks, Ninon de Lenclos, the most infamous courtesan of
seventeentlrcentury France, listened patiently as the Marquis de Sevigné
explained his struggles in pursuing a beautiful but difficult young countess.
Ninon was sixty~two at the time, and more than experienced in matters of
love; the marquis was a lad of twenty-two, handsome, dashing, but hope
lessly inexperienced in romance. At first Ninon was amused to hear the
marquis talk about his mistakes, but finally she had had enough. Unable to
bear ineptitude in any realm, least of all in seducing a woman, she decided
to take the young man under her wing. First, he had to understand that this
was war, and that the beautiful countess was {citadel to which he had to
lay siege as carefully as any general. Every step had to be planned and exe-
cuted with the utmost attention to detail and nuance.

Instructing the marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach the
countess with a bit of distance, an air of nonchalance. The next time the
two were alone together, she said, he would confide in the countess as
would a friend but notva potential lover. This was to throw her off the scent.
The countess was no longer to take his interest in her for granted-perhaps
he was only interested in friendship.

Ninon planned ahead. Once the countess was confused, it would be
time to make her jealous. At the next encounter, at a major féte in Paris, the
marquis would show up with a beautiful young woman at his side. This
beautiful young woman had equally beautiful friends, so that wherever the
countess would now see the marquis, he would be surrounded by the most
stunning young women in Paris. Not only would the countess be seething
with jealousy, she would come to see the marquis as someone who was de-
sired by others. It was hard for Ninon to make the marquis understand, but
she patiently explained that a woman who is interested in a man wants to
see that other women are interested in him, too. Not only does that give
him instant value, it makes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from
their clutches.

Once the countess was jealous but intrigued, it would be time to be-
guile her. On Ninon’s instructions, the marquis would fail to show up at af-
fairs where the countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly, he would
appear at salons he had never frequented before, but that the countess at-

LAW 3

I7

tended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of this would
push her into the state of emotional confusion that is a prerequisite for sum
cessful seduction.

These moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon moni-
tored the marquis’s progress: Through her network of spies, she heard how
the countess would laugh a little harder at his witticisms,
listen more
closely to his stories. She heard that the countess was suddenly asking ques-
tions about him. Her friends told her that at social affairs the countess
would often look up at the marquis, following his steps. Ninon felt certain
that the young woman was falling under his spell. It was a matter of weeks
now, maybe a month or two, but if all went smoothly, the citadel would
fall.

A few days later the marquis was at the countess’s home. They were
alone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his own im—
pulse, rather than following Ninon’s instructions, he took the countess’s
hands and told her he was in love with her. The young woman seemed
confused, 3 reaction he did not expect. She became polite, then excused
herself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his eyes, was not there to
say goodnight to him. The next few times he visited he was told she was
not at home. When she finally admitted him again, the two felt awkward
and uncomfortable with each other. The spell was broken.

Interpretation
Ninon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The greatest writ-
ers, thinkers, and politicians of the time had been her lovers——men like La
Rochefoucauld, Moliére, and Richelieu. Seduction was a game to her, to be
practiced with skill. As she got older, and her reputation grew, the most im~
portant families in France would send their sons to her to be instructed in
matters of love.

Ninon knew that men and women are very different, but when it
comes to seduction they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often sense
when they are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feel-
ing of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other per-
son to detour you into a strange country. Everything in seduction,
however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce your intentions or
reveal them directly in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the
scent. To surrender to your guidance they must be appropriately confused.
You have to scramble your signals——~appea.r interested in another man or
woman (the decoy), then hint at being interested in the target, then feign
indifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite.

Imagine this story from the countess’s perspective: After a few of the
marquis’s moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of game,
but the game delighted her. She did not know where he was leading her,
but so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of them keeping her
waiting for the next one———she even enjoyed her jealousy and confusion, for
sometimes any emotion is be-tier than the boredom of security. Perhaps the
marquis had ulterior motives; most men do. But she was willing to wait and

18

LAW 3

see, and probably if she had been made to wait long enough, what he was
up to would not have mattered.

The moment the marquis uttered that fatal word “love,” however, all
was changed. This was no longer a game with moves, it was an artless show
of passion. His intention was revealed: He was seducing her. This put
everything he had done in a new light. All that before had been charming
now seemed ugly and conniving; the countess felt embarrassed and used.
A door closed that would never open again.

Do not be held a cheat, even though 2&#x27;! is impossible to live today without being one.
Let your greatest cunning lie in covering up what looks like cunning.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirty—five—yearvold deputy in
the Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career. The issues of
the day were the unification of the many states (including Prussia) into
which Germany was then divided, and a war against Austria, the powerful
neighbor to the south that hoped to keep the Germans weak and at odds,
even threatening to intervene if they tried to unite. Prince William, next in
line to be P:ussia’s king, was in favor of going to war, and the parliament
rallied to the cause, prepared to back any mobilization of troops. The only
ones to oppose war were the present king, Frederick William IV, and his
ministers, who preferred to appease the powerful Austrians.

Throughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even passionate
supporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of German unifica-
tion, of going to war against Austria and humiliating the country that for so
long had kept Germany divided. A former soldier, he saw warfare as a glo-
rious business.

This, after all, was the man who years later would say, “The great
questions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions, but
by iron and blood.”

Passionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck nevertheless
gave a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever that astonished
all who heard it “Woe unto the statesman,” he said, “who makes war with-
out a reason that will still be valid when the war is over! After the war, you
will all look differently at these questions. Will you then have the courage
to turn to the peasant contemplating the ashes of his farm, to the man who
has been crippled, to the father who has lost his children?” Not only did
Bismarck go on to talk of the madness of this war, but, strangest of all, he
praised Austria and defended her actions. This went against everything he
had stood for. The consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against
the wa.r——what could this possibly mean? Other deputies were confused,
and several of them changed their votes. Eventually the king and his minis-
ters won out, and war was averted.

A few weeks after Bisma.rck’s infamous speech, the king, grateful that

LAW 3

19

he had spoken for peace, made him a cabinet minister. A few years later he
became the Prussian premier. In this role he eventually led his country and
a. peace-loving king into a war against Austria, crushing the former empire
and establishing a

German state, with Prussia at its head.

lnterpretation
At the time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several calculations.
First, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not kept pace with
other European armies, was unready for war--that Austria, in fact, might
very well win, a disastrous result for the future. Second, if the war were lost
and Bismarck had supported it, his career would be gravely jeopardized.
The king and his conservative ministers wanted peace; Bismarck wanted
power. The answer was to throw people off the scent by supporting a cause
he cletested, saying things he would laugh at if said by another. A whole
country was fooled. It was because of Bismarck’s speech that the king made
him a minister, at position from which he quickly rose to be prime minister,
attaining the power to strengthen the Prussian military and accomplish
what he had wanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unifica»
tion of Germany under Prussia’s leadership.

Bismarck was certainly one of the cleverest statesman who ever lived,
a master of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he was up to in
this case. Had he announced his real intentions, arguing that it was better
to wait now and fight later, he would not have won the argument, since
most Prussians wanted war at that moment and mistakenly believed that
their army was superior to the Austrians. Had he played up to the king,
asking to be made a minister in exchange for supporting peace, he would
not have succeeded either: The king would have distrusted his ambition
and doubted his sincerity.

By being completely insincere and sending misleading signals, how-
ever, he deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained every-
thing he wanted. Such is the power of hiding your intentions.

KEYS TO POWER
Most people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out their opin-
ions at every opportunity, and constantly reveal their plans and intentions.
They do this for several reasons. First, it is easy and natural to always want
to talk about one’s feelings and plans for the future. It takes effort to control
your tongue and monitor what you reveal. Second, many believe that by
being honest and open they are winning people&#x27;s hearts and showing their
good nature.They are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instru-
ment, which bloodies more than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to offend
people; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what
they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or
think. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so
predictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you,
and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions.

20

LAW 3

If you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train yourself in
the art of concealing your intentions. Master the art and you will always
have the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one’s intentions is a
simple tmth about human nature: Our first instinct is to always trust ap-
pearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and
hear—-constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else
would exhaust and terrify us. This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal
one’s intentions. Simply dangle an object you seem to desire, a goal you
seem to aim for, in front of people’s eyes and they will take the appearance
for reality. Once their eyes focus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what
you are really up to. In seduction, set up conflictinghsignals, such as desire
and indiiference, and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame
their desire to possess you.

A tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to
support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments.
(Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.) Most people will
believe you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to
play so lightly with something as emotional as one’s opinions and values.
The same applies for any decoyed object of desire: Seem to want some-
thing in which you are actually not at all interested and your enemies will
be thrown oil the scent. making all kinds of errors in their calculations.

During the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of Marl-
borough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French fort,
because it protected a vital thoroughfare into France. Yet he knew that if be
destroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted-to advance down
that road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it with
some of his troops, making it appear as if he wanted it for some purpose of
his own. The French attacked the fort and the duke let them recapture it.
Once they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had
wanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road
was unprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France,

Use this tactic in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by
closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspi-
cious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals—~just not your
real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly,
open, and trusting; you conceal your intentions; and you send your rivals
on timeconsuming wild~goose chases.

Another powerful tool in throwing people oh’ the scent is false sincer-
ity. People easily mjstake sincerity for honesty. Remember-their first in
stinct is to trust appearances, and since they value honesty and want to
believe in the honesty of those around them, they will rarely doubt you or
see through your act. Seeming to believe what you say gives your words
great weight. This is how Iago deceived and destroyed Othello: Given the
depth of his emotions, the apparent sincerity of his concerns about Desde—
rnona’s supposed infidelity, how could Othello distrust him? This is also
how the great con artist Yellow Kid Weil pulled the wool over suckers’
eyes: Seeming to believe so deeply in the decayed object he was dangling

LAW 3

,2]

in front of them (a phony stock, a. touted racehorse), he made its reality
hard to doubt. It is important, of course, not to go too far in this area. Sin~
cexity is a tricky tool: Appear overpassionate and you raise suspicions. Be
measured and believable or your ruse will seem the put-on that it is.

To make your false sincerity an effective weapon in concealing your
intentions, espouse a belief in honesty and fertlirightness as important so-
cial values. Do this as publicly as possible. Emphasize your position on this
subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt thought-though only one
that is actually meaningless or irrelevant, of course. Napoleon&quot;; minister
Talleyrand was a master at taking people into his confidence by revealing
some apparent secret. This feigned confidence——a decoy—-would then
elicit a real confidence on the other person’s part.

Remember: The best deceivers do everything they can to cloak their

{roguish qualities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise

their dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal
of weapons.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
In 1910, a Mr. Sam Geezil of Chicago sold his warehouse business for close
to $1 million. He settled down to semiretirement and the managing of his
many properties, but deep inside he itched for the old days of deal-making.
One day a young man named Joseph Weil visited his office, wanting to buy
an apartment he had up for sale. Geezil explained the terms: The price was
$8,000, but he only required a down payment of $2,000. Weil said he
would sleep on it, but he came back the following day and offered to pay
the full $8,000 in cash, if Geezil could wait a couple of days, until a deal
Weil was working on came through. Even in semiretirement, a clever busi-
nessman like Geezil was curious as to how Weil would be able to come up
with so much cash (roughly $150,000 today) so quickly. Wei] seemed reluc-
tant to say, and quickly changed the subject, but Geezil was persistent. Fi-
nally, after assurances of confidentiality, Weil told Geezil
the following
story.

Weil’s uncle was the secretary to a coterie of multimillionaire fi-
nanciers. These wealthy gentlemen had purchased a hunting lodge in
Michigan ten years ago, at a cheap price. They had not used the lodge for a
few years, so they had decided to sell it and had asked Weil’s uncle to get
whatever he could for it. For reasons——-good reasons—of his own, the uncle
had been nursing a grudge against the millionaires for years; this was his
chance to get back at them. He would sell the property for $35,000 to a set-
up man (whom it was Weil’s job to find). The financiers were too wealthy to
worry about this low price. The set-up man would then turn around and
sell the property again for its real price, around $155,000. The uncle, Weil,
and the third man would split the profits from this second sale. It was all
legal and for a good cause—the uncle’s just retribution.

Geezil had heard enough: He wanted to be the set-up buyer. Weil was
reluctant to involve him, but Geezil would not back dovmz The idea of a
large profit, plus a little adventure, had him champing at the bit. Weil ex-
plained that Geezil would have to put up the $35,000 in cash to bring the
deal off. Geezil, a millionaire, said he could get the money with a snap of
his fingers. Weil finally relented and agreed to arrange a meeting between
the uncle, Geezil, and the financiers, in the town of Galesburg, Illinois.

man, with whom he avidly discussed business. Weil also brought along a
companion, a somewhat paundiy man named George Gross. Weil ex-
plained to Geezil that he himself was a boxing trainer, that Gross was one
of the promising piizefighters he trained, and that he had asked Gross to
come along to make sure the fighter stayed in shape. For a promising
fighter, Gross was unimpressive looking—he had gray hair and a beer
belly—but Geezil was so excited about the deal that he didn‘t really think
about the man’s flabby appearance.

Once in Galesburg, Weil and his uncle went to fetch the financiers
while Geezil waited in a hotel room with Gross, who promptly put on his
boxing trunks. As Geezil half watched, Gross began to shadowbox. Dis-
tracted as he was, Geezil ignored how badly the boxer wheezed after a few
minutes of exercise, although his style seemed real enough. An hour later,
Weil and his uncle reappeared with the financiers, an impressive, intimidat
ing gmup of men, all wearing fancy suits. The meeting went well and the fi-
nanciers agreed to sell
the lodge to Geezil, who had already had the
$35,000 wired to a local bank.

This minor business now settled, the financiers sat back in their chairs
and began to banter about high finance, throwing out the name ‘f]. P. Mor~
gain” as if they knew the man. Finally one of them noticed the boxer in the
corner of the room. Weil explained what he was doing there. The financier
countered that he too had a boxer in his entourage, whom he named. Weil
laughed brazenly and exclaimed that his man could easily knock out their
man. Conversation escalated into argument. In the heat of passion, Weil
challenged the men to a bet. The financiers eagerly agreed and left to get
their man ready for a fight the next day.

As soon as they had left, the uncle yelled at Weil, right in front of
Geezil: They did not have enough money to bet with, and once the fi-
nanciers discovered this, the uncle would be fired. Weil apologized for get»
ting him in this mess, but he had a plan: He knew the other boxer well, and
with a little bribe, they could fix the fight. But where would the money
come from for the bet? the uncle replied. Without it they were as good as
dead. Finally Geezil had heard enough. Unwilling to jeopardize his deal
with any ill will, he offered his own $35,000 cash for part of the bet. Even if
he lost that, he would wire for more money and still make a. profit on the
sale of the lodge. The uncle and nephew thanked him. With their own
$15,000 and Geezil’s $35,000 they would manage to have enough for the
bet. That evening, as Geezil watched the two boxers rehearse the fix in
the hotel room, his mind reeled at the killing he was going to make from both
the boxing match and the sale of the lodge.

The fight took place in a gym the next day. Well handled the cash,
which was placed for security in a locked box. Everything was pro»
ceeding as planned in the hotel room. The financiers were looking glum at
how badly their fighter was doing, and Geezil was dreaming about the easy
money he was about to make. Then, suddenly, a wild swing by the li-
nai1cier’s fighter hit Gross hard in the face, knocking him down. When he
hit the canvas, blood spurted from his mouth. He coughed, then lay still.

THOMAS Crmsv, 1991

One of the financiers, a former doctor, checked his pulse; he was dead. The
millionaires panicked: Everyone had to get out before the police arrived-—
they could all be charged with murder.

Terrified, Geezil hightailed it out of the gym and back to Chicago, leav-
ing behind his $35,000 which he was only too glad to forget, for it seemed
a small price to pay to avoid being implicated in a crime. He never wanted
to see Weil or any of the others again.

After Geezil scurried out, Gross stood up, under his own steam. The
blood that had spurted from his mouth came from a ball filled with chicken
blood and hot water that he had hidden in his cheek. The whole affair had
been masterminded by Weil, better known as “the Yellow Kid,” one of the
most creative con artists in history. Weil split the $35,000 with the fi-
nanciers and the boxers (all fellow con a:u&#x27;sts)—a nice little profit for a few
days’ work.

Interpretation
The Yellow Kid had staked out Geezil as the perfect sucker long before he
set up the con. He knew the boxingmatch scam would be the perfect ruse
to separate Geezil from his money quickly and definitively. But he also
knew that if he had begun by trying to interest Geezil in the boxing match,
he would have failed miserably. He had to conceal his intentions and
switch attention, create a smoke screen-—-in this case the sale of the lodge.

On the train ride and in the hotel room Geezil’s mind had been com-
pletely occupied with the pending deal, the easy money, the chance to
hobnob with wealthy men. He had failed to notice that Gross was out of
shape and middle-aged at best. Such is the distracting power of a smoke
screen. Engrossed in the business deal, Gee-zil’s attention was easily di—
verted to the boxing match, but only at a point when it was already too late
for him to notice the details that would have given Gross away. The match,
after all, now depended on a bribe rather than on the boxer’s physical condi~
lion. And Geezil was so distracted at the end by the illusion ofthe boxer’s death
that he completely forgot about his money.

Learn from the Yellow Kid: The familiar, inconspicuous front is the
perfect smoke screen. Approach your mark with an idea that seems ordi~
nary enough—a business deal, financial intrigue. The sucker’s mind is dis
tracted, his suspicions allayed. That is when you gently guide him onto the
second path, the slippery slope down which he slides helplessly into your
trap.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In the mid-1920s, the powerful warlords of Ethiopia were coming to the re-
alization that a young man of the nobility named Haile Selassie, also
known as Ras Tafari, was outcompeting them all and nearing the point
where he could proclaim himself their leader, unifying the country for the
first time in decades. Most of his rivals could not understand how this
wispy,&#x27;quiet, mild—mannered man had been able to take control. Yet in

1927, Selassie was able to summon the warlords, one at a time, to come to
Amldis Ababa to declare their loyalty and recognize him as leader.

Some hurried, some hesitated, but only one, Dejazmach Balcha of
Sidamo, dared defy Selassie totally. A blustery man, Balcha was a great
warrior, and he considered the new leader weak and unworthy. He point-
edly stayed away from the capital. Finally Selassie, in his gentle but stern
way, commanded Balcha to come. The warlord decided to obey, but in
doing so he would turn the tables on this pretender to the Ethiopian
throne: He would come to Addis Ababa at his own speed, and with an
army of 10,000 men, a. force large enough to defend himself, perhaps even
start a civil war. Stationing this formidable force in a valley three miles
from the capital, he waited, as a king would. Selassie would have to come
to him.

Selassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an after»
noon banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fool, knew history—he knew
that previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets as a trap.
Once he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have him arrested or
murdered. To signal his understanding of the situation, he agreed to come
to the banquet, but only if he could bring his personal b0dyguaId—-500 of
his best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend him and themselves. To
Balcha’s surprise, Selassie answered with the utmost politeness that he
would be honored to play host to such warriors.

On the way to the banquet, Balcha warned his soldiers not to get
drunk and to be on their guard. When they arrived at the palace, Selassie
was his charming best. He deferred to Balcha, treated him as if he desper-
ately needed his approval and cooperation. But Balcha refused to be
charmed, and he warned Selassie that if he did not return to his camp by
nightfall, his army had orders to attack the capital. Selassie reacted as if
hurt by his mistrust. Over the meal, when it came time for the traditional
singing of songs in honor of Ethiopia’s leaders, he made a. point of allowing
only songs honoring the warlord of Sidarno. It seemed to Balcha that Se»
lassie was scared, intimidated by this great warrior who could not be out-
wittecl. Sensing the change, Balcha believed that he would be the one to
call the shots in the days to come.

At the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their march
back to camp amidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to the capital
over his shoulder, he planned his strategy—-how his own soldiers would
march through the capital in triumph within weeks, and Selassie would be
put in his place, his place being either prison or death. When Balcha came
in sight of his camp, however, he saw that something was terribly wrong.
Where before there had been colorful tents stretching as far as the eye
could see, now there was nothing, only smoke from doused fires. What
devil’s magic was this?

A witness told Balcha what had happened. During the banquet, a large
army, commanded by an ally of Selassie’s, had stolen up on Balcha’s en-
campment by a side route he had not seen. This army had not come to
light, however: Knowing that Balcha would/have heard a noisy battle and

26

LAW 3

hurried back with his 600-man bodyguard, Selassie had .armed his own
troops with baskets of gold and cash. They had surrounded Balcha’s army
and proceeded to purchase every last one of their weapons. Those who re»
fused were easily intimidated. Within a few hours, Balcha’s entire force had
been disarmed and scattered in all directions.

Realizing his danger, Balcha decided to march south with his 600 sol-
diers to regroup, but the same army that had disarmed his soldiers blocked
his way. The other way out was to march on the capital, but Selassie had set
a large army to defend it. Like a chess player, he had predicted Balcha’s
moves, and had checkmatecl him. For the first time in his life, Balcha sur-
rendered. To repent his sins of pride and ambition, he agreed to enter a
monastery.

‘

Interpretation
Throughout Selassie’s long reign, no one could quite figure him out.
Ethiopians like their leaders fierce, but Selassie, who wore the front of a
gentle, peaceloving man, lasted longer than any of them. Never angry or
impatient, he lured his victims with sweet smiles, lulling them with charm
and obsequiousness before he attacked. In the case of Balcha, Selassie
played on the man’s wariness, his suspicion that the banquet was a trap—
which in fact it was, but not the one he expected. Selassie’s way of allaying
Balcha’s fears—letting him bring his bodyguard to the banquet, giving him
top billing there, making him feel in contro1—-created a thick smoke screen,
concealing the real action three miles away.

Remember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive.
Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their
View in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating
blow. A helpful or apparently honest gesture, or one that implies the other
persorfs supen‘ority——these are perfect diversionary devices.

Properly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It en-
abled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing a single
bullet.

Do not underestimate the power of Tafari. He creefis
like a mouse but he has jaws like a lion.

KEYS TO POWER
If you believe that deceivers are colorful folk who mislead with elaborate
lies and tall tales, you are greatly mistaken. The best deceivers utilize a
bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention to themselves. They
know that extravagant words and gestures immediately raise suspicion. In-
stead, they envelop their marlc in the familiar, the banal, the ha.rmless. In
Yellow Kid Weil’s dealings with Sam Geezil, the familiar was a business
deal. In the Ethiopian case, it was Selassie’s misleading obsequiousness—
exactly what&#x27;Balcha. would have expected from a weaker warlord.

LAW 3

27

Once you have lulled your suckers’ attention with the familiar, they
will not notice the deception being perpetrated behind their backs. This
derives from a simple truth: people can only focus on one thing at a time. It
is really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and harmless per~
son they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up something else. The
grayer and more uniform the smoke in your smoke screen, the better it
conceals your intentions. In the decoy and red herring devices discussed in
Part I, you actively distract people; in the smoke screen, you lull your vic-
tims, drawing them into your web. Because it is so hypnotic, this is often
the best way of concealing your intentions.

The simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind a bland,
unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection.
This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to per-
fect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelfs face. Baron
james Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts be
hind bland smiles and nondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand,
“Never was a face less of a barometer.” Henry Kissinger would bore his op—
ponents around the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice,
his blank look, his endless recitations of details; then, as their eyes glazed
over, he would suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off»
guard, they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains it,
“While playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead he
practices a bland behavior that minimizes readable patterns, frustrates and
confuses opponents, permits greater concentration,”

An adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be practiced on a num-
ber of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of distraction and
misdirection. One of the most effective smoke screens is the noble gesture.
People want to believe apparently noble gestures are genuine, for the belief
is pleasant. They rarely notice how deceptive these gestures can be.

The art dealerjoseph Duveen was once confronted with a terrible prob-
lem. The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen’s paintings were
running out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes getting ever higher, it
seemed unlikely that they would keep buying. The solution was the National
Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which Duveen helped create in 1937 by
getting Andrew Mellon to donate his collection to it. The National Gallery
was the perfect front for Duveen. In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes,
cleared wall space for new purchases, and reduced the number of paintings
on the market, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices. All this
while the donors created the appearance of being public benefactors.

Another effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment of a se
ries of actions that seduce the victim into believing you will continue in the
same way. The pattern plays on the psychology of anticipation: Our behav~
ior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think.

In 1878 the American robber baronjay Gould created a company that
began to threaten the monopoly of the telegraph company Western Union.
The directors of Western Union decided to buy Gould’s company up-

LAW 3

they had to spend a hefty sum, but they figured they had managed to rid
themselves of an irritating competitor. A few months later, though, Gould
was it at again, complaining he had been treated unfairly. He started up a
second company to compete with Western Union and its new acquisition.
The same thing happened again: Western Union bought him out to shut
him up. Soon the pattern began for the third time, but now Gould went for
the jugular: He suddenly staged a bloody takeover struggle and managed
to gain complete control of Western Union. He had established a pattern
that had tricked the company’s directors into thinking his goal was to be
bought out at a handsome rate. Once they paid him off, they relaxed and
failed to notice that he was actually playing for higher stakes. The pattern is
powerful in that it deceives the other person into expecting the opposite of
what you are really doing.

Anotlier psychological weakness on which to construct a smoke screen
is the tendency to mistake appearances for reality-——the feeling that if some-
one seems to belong to your group, their belonging must be real. This habit
makes the seamless blend a very effective front. The trick is simple: You sim«
ply blend in with those around you. The better you blend, the less suspi-
cious you become. During the Cold War of the 1950s and ’60s, as is now
notorious, a slew of British civil servants passed secrets to the Soviets. They
went undetected for years because they were apparently decent chaps, had
gone to all the right schools, and lit the oldvboy network perfectly. Blend~
ing in is the perfect smoke screen for spying. The better you do it, the bet-
ter you can conceal your intentions.

Remember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors,
to put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not despair at having to wear
such a bland rnask~—it is often your unreadability that draws people to you
and makes you appear a person of power.

Authority: Have you ever heard of a skillful general, who intends to
surprise a citadel, announcing his plan to his enemy? Conceal your
purpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of your
designs until they cannot be opposed. until the combat is over. Win
the victory before you declare the war. In a word, imitate those walk
like people whose designs are not known except by the ravaged coun—
try through which they have passed. (Ninon cle Lenclos, 16234706)

REVERSAL
No smoke screen, red herring, false sincerity, or any other diversionary de-
vice will succeed in concealing your intentions if you already have an es-
tablished reputation for deception. And as you get older and achieve
success, it often becomes increasingly difficult to disguise your cunning.
Everyone knows you practice deception; persist in playing naive and you
run the risk of seeming the rankest hypocrite, which will severely limit
your room to maneuver. In such cases it is better to own up, to appear the
honest rogue, or, better, the repentant rogue. Not only will you be admired
for your frankness, but, most wonderful and strange of all, you will be able
to continue your stratagems.

As P. T. Barnum, the nineteenth-century king of humbuggery, grew
older, he learned to embrace his reputation as a grand deceiver. At one
point he organized a buffalo hunt in New jersey, complete with Indians
and a few imported buffalo. He publicized the hunt as genuine, but it came
off as so completely fake that the crowd, instead of getting angry and ask-
ing for their money back, was greatly amused. They knew Barnum pulled
t:ricks all the time; that was the secret of his success, and they loved him for
it. Learning a lesson from this affair, Barnum stopped concealing all of his
devices, even revealing his deceptions in a tell—all autobiography. As
Kierkegaard wrote, “The world wants to be deceived.”

Finally, although it is wiser to divert attention from your purposes by
presenting a bland, familiar exterior, there are times when the colorful,
conspicuous gesture is the right diversionary tactic. The great charlatan
mountebanks of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe used humor
and entertainment to deceive their audiences. Dazzled by a great show, the
public would not notice the charlatans’ real intentions. Thus the star charla-
tan himself would appear in town in a night-black coach drawn by black
horses. Clowns, tightrope walkers, and star entertainers would accompany
him, pulling people in to his demonstrations of elixirs and quack potions.
The charlatan made entertainment seem like the business of the day; the
business of the day was actually the sale of the elixirs and quack potions.

Spectacle and entertainment, clearly, are excellent devices to conceal
your intentions, but they cannot be used indefinitely. The public grows
tired and suspicious, and eventually catches on to the trick. And indeed the
charlatans had to move quickly from town to town, before word spread
that the potions were useless and the entertainment a trick. Powerful peo-
ple with bland exteriors, on the other hand—the Talleyrands, the Roth-
the Selassies—can practice their deceptions in the same place
schilds,
throughout their lifetimes. Their act never wears thin, and rarely causes
suspicion. The colorful smoke screen should be used cautiously, then, and
only when the occasion is right.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Gnaeus Marcius, also known as Coriolanus, was a great military hero of
ancient Rome. In the first half of the fifth century B.C. he won many impor-
tant battles, saving the city from calamity time and time again. Because he
spent most of his time on the battlefield, few Romans knew him personally,
making him something of a legendary figure.

In 454 B.C., Coriolanus decided it was time to exploit his reputation
and enter politics. He stood for election to the high rank of consul. Candi—
dates for this position traditionally made a public address early in the race,
and when Coriolanus came before the people, he began by displaying the
dozens of scars he had accumulated over seventeen years of fighting for
Rome. Few in the crowd really heard the lengthy speech that followed;
those scars, proof of his valor and patriotism, moved the people to tears.
Coriola.nus’s election seemed certain.

When the polling day arrived, however, Coriolanus made an entry
into the forum escorted by the entire senate and by the city’s patricians, the
aristocracy. The common people who saw this were disturbed by such a
blustering show of confidence on election day.

And then Coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressing the wealthy citi-
zens who had accompanied him. His words were arrogant and insolent.
Claiming certain victory in the vote, he boasted of his battlefield exploits,
made sour jokes that appealed only to the patricians, voiced angry accuser»
tions against his opponents, and speculated on the riches he would bring to
Rome. This time the people listened: They had not realized that this leg-
endary soldier was also a common braggart.

News of Coriolanus’s second speech spread quickly through Rome,
and the people turned out in great numbers to make sure he was not
elected. Defeated, Coriolanus returned to the battlefield, bitter and vowing
revenge on the common folk who had voted against him. Some weeks later
a large shipment of grain arrived in Rome. The senate was ready to distrib~
ute this food to the people, for free, but just as they were preparing to vote
on the question Coriolanus appeared on the scene and took the senate
floor. The distribution, he argued, would have a. harmful effect on the city
as a whole. Several senators appeared won over, and the vote on the distri-
bution fell into doubt. Coiiolanus did not stop there: He went on to con—
demo the concept of democracy itself. He advocated getting rid of the
people’s represen!atives—the tribunes-—-and turning over the governing of
the city to the patricians.

When word of Coriolanus’s latest speech reached the people, their
anger knew no bounds. The tribunes were sent to the senate to demand
that Coriolanus appear before them. He refused. Riots broke out all over
the city. The senate, fearing the people’s wrath, finally voted in favor of the
grain distribution. The tribunes were appeased, but the people still do
manded that Coriolanus speak to them and apologize. If he repented, and
agreed to keep his opinions to himself, he would be allowed to return to
the battlefield.

Coriolanus did appear one last time before the people, who listened to

he became more and more blunt. Yet again he hurled insults! His tone was
arrogant, his expression disdainful. The more he spoke, the angtier the
people became. Finally they shouted him down and silenced him.

The tribunes conferred, condemned Coriolanus to death, and ordered
the magistrates to take him at once to the top of the Titrpeian rock and
throw him over. The delighted crowd seconded the decision. The patri-
cians, however, managed to intervene, and the sentence was commuted to
a lifelong banishment. When the people found out that Rome’s great mili-
tary hero would never retum to the city, they celebrated in the streets. In
fact no one had ever seen web a celebration, not even after the defeat of a
foreign enemy.

Interpretation
Before his entrance into politics, the name of Coriolanus evoked awe.

His battlefield accomplishments showed him as a man of great brav-
ery. Since the citizens knew little about him, all kinds of legends became at-
tached to his name. The moment he appeared before the Roman citizens,
however, and spoke his mind, all that grandeur and mystery vanished. He
bragged and blustered like a common soldier. He insulted and slandered
people, as if he felt threatened and insecure. Suddenly he was not at all
what the people had imagined. The discrepancy between the legend and
the reality proved immensely disappointing to those who wanted to be
lieve in their hero. The more Coriolanus said,
the less powerful he ap-
peared——-a person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot
control himself, and is unworthy of respect.

Had Coriolanus said less, the people would never have had cause to
be offended by him, would never have known his true feelings. He would
have maintained his powerful aura, would certainly have been elected con’
sul, and would have been able to accomplish his antidemocratic goals. But
the human tongue is a beast that few can master. It strains constantly to
break out of its cage, and if it is not tamed, it will run wild and cause you
grief. Power cannot accrue to those who squander their treasure of words.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the court of Louis XIV, nobles and ministers would spend days and
nights debating issues of state. They would confer, argue, make and break
alliances, and argue again, until finally the critical moment arrived: Two of
them would be chosen to represent the different sides to Louis himself,
who would decide what should be done. After these persons were chosen,

LAW 4

3:3’

everyone would argue some more: How should the issues he phrased?
What would appeal to Louis, what would annoy him? At what fime of day
should the representatives approach him, and in what part of the Versailles
palace? What expression should they have on their faces?

Finally, after all this was settled, the fateful moment would finally at»
rive. The two men would approach Louis—always a delicate matterwand
when they finally had his ear, they would talk about the issue at hand,
spelling out the options in detail.

Louis would listen in silence, a most enigmatic look on his face. Fi-
nally, when each had finished his presentation and had asked for the king’s
opinion, he would look at them both and say, “I shall see.” Then he would
walk away‘

The ministers and courtiers would never hear another word on this
subject from the king——they would simply see the result, weeks later, when
he would come to a decision and act. He would never bother to consult
them on the matter again.

lnterpretation
Louis XIV was a man of very few words. His most famous remark is
&quot; ‘fiat, c’est moi” (“I am the state”); nothing could be more pithy yet more
eloquent. His infamous “I shall see” was one of several extremely short
phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests.

Louis was not always this way; as a young man he was known for talk-
ing at length, delighting in his own eloquence. His later taciturnity was self-
imposed, an act, a mask he used to keep everybody below him off-balance.
No one knew exactly where he stood, or could predict his reactions. No
one could try to deceive him by saying what they thought he wanted to
hear, because no one knew what he wanted to hear. As they talked on and
on to the silent Louis, they revealed more and more about themselves, in-
formation he would later use against them to great effect.

In the end, Louis’s silence kept those around him terrified and under
his thumb. It was one of the foundations of his power. As Saint—Simon
wrote, “No one knew as well as he how to sell his words, his smile, even his
glances. Everything in him was valuable because he created differences,
and his majesty was enhanced by the sparseness of his words.”

It is evm more damagingfor a minister to sayfoalish things than to do them.

Your short answers and silences will put them on the defensive, and
they will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments
that will reveal valuable information about them and their weaknesses.
They will leave a meeting with you feeling as if they had been robbed, and
they will go home and ponder your every word. This extra attention to
your brief comments will only add to your power.

Saying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only. In most
areas of life, the less you say, the more profound and mysterious you ap-
pear. As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation that it was
generally impossible to get people to do what you wanted them to do by
talking to them. They would turn against you, subvert your wishes, disobey
you out of sheer perversity. He once told a friend, “I learned that you actu~
ally have more power when you shut up.”

in his later life Warhol employed this strategy with great success. His
interviews were exercises in oracular speech: He would say something
vague and ambiguous, and the interviewer would twist in circles trying to
figure it out, imagining there was something profound behind his often
meaningless phrases. Warhol rarely talked about his work; he let others do
the interpreting. He claimed to have learned this technique from that mas-
ter of enigma Marcel Duchamp, another twentieth-century artist who real-
ized early on that the less he said about his work, the more people talked
about it. And the more they talked, the more valuable his work became.

By saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning
and power. Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of saying something
foolish, even dangerous. In 1825 a new czar, Nicholas 1, ascended the
throne of Russia. A rebellion immediately broke out, led by liberals de-
manding that the country modemize~—-that its industries and civil struc-
tures catch up with the rest of Europe. Brutally crushing this rebellion (the
Decembrist Uprising), Nicholas I sentenced one of its leaders, Kondraty
Ryleyev, to death. On the day of the execution Ryleyev stood on the
lows, the noose around his neck. The trapdoor opened~——~but as Ryleyev
dangled, the rope broke, dashing him to the ground. At the time, events
like this were considered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a man
saved from execution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got to his
feet, bruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he called
out to the crowd, “You see, in Russia they don’t know how to do anything
properly, not even how to make rope!”

A messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of the
failed hanging. Vexed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas 1 never-
theless began to sign the pardon. But then: “Did Ryleyev say anything after
this miracle?” the czar asked the messenger. “Sire,” the messenger replied,
“he said that in Russia they don’t even know how to make rope.”

“In that case,” said the Czar, “let us prove the contrary,” and he tore
up the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time the
rope did not break.

REVERSAL
There are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion
and even insecurity, especially in your superiors; a vague or ambiguous
comment can open you up to interpretations you had not bargained for. Si-
lence and saying less than necessary must be practiced with caution, then,
and in the right situations. It is occasionally wiser to imitate the court jester,
who plays the fool but knows he is smarter than the king. He talks and talks
and entertains, and no one suspects that he is more than just a fool.

Also. words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any de-
ception you might practice. By bending your listener’s ear with talk, you
can distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the less suspi-
cious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as sly and ma-
nipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated. This is the reverse of the
silent policy employed by the powerful: By talking more, and making
yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than your mark, you can prac-
tice deception with greater ease.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAWI
During China’s War of the Three Kingdoms (A.D. 207—265), the great gen-
eral Chuko Liang, leading the forces of the Sim Kingdom, dispatched his
vast army to a distant camp while he rested in a small town with a handful
of soldiers. Suddenly sentinels hurried in with the alarming news that an
enemy force of over 150,000 troops under Sima Yi was approaching. With
only a hundred men to defend him, Chuko Liang’s situation was hopeless.
The enemy would finally capture this renowned leader.

Without lamenting his fate, or wasting time trying to figure out how he
had been caught, Liang ordered his troops to take down their flags, throw
open the city gates, and hide. He himself then took a seat on the most visi-
ble part of the city’s wall, wearing a Taoist robe. He lit some incense,
strummed his lute, and began to chant. Minutes later he could see the vast
enemy army approaching, an endless phalanx of soldiers. Pretending not
to notice them, he continued to sing and play the lute.

Soon the army stood at the town gates, At its head was Sima Yi, who

instantly recognized the man on the wall.

Even so, as his soldiers itched to enter the unguarded town through its
open gates, Sima Yi hesitated, held them back, and studied Liang on the
wall. Then, he ordered an immediate and speedy retreat.

Interpretation
Chuko Liang was commonly known as the “Sleeping Dragon.” His ex-
ploits in the War of the Three Kingdoms were legendary. Once a man
claiming to be a disaffected enemy lieutenant came to his camp, offering
help and information. Liang instantly recognized the situation as a setup;
this man was a false deserter, and should be beheaded. At the last minute,
though, as the ax was about to fall, Liang stopped the execution and of-
fered to spare the man’s life if he agreed to become a double agent. Grate
ful and terrified, the man agreed, and began supplying false information to
the enemy. Liang won battle after battle.

On another occasion Liang stole a military seal and created false docu-
ments dispatching his enemy’s troops to distant locations. Once the troops
had dispersed, he was able to capture three cities, so that he controlled an
entire corridor of the enemy’s kingdom. He also once tricked the enemy
into believing one of its best generals was a traitor, forcing the man to es-
cape and join forces with Liang. The Sleeping Dragon carefully cultivated
his reputation of being the cleverest man in China, one who always had a
trick up his sleeve. As powerful as any weapon, this reputation struck fear
into his enemy.

Sima Yi had fought against Chuko Liang dozens of times and knew
him well. When he came on the empty city, with Liang praying on the
wall, he was stunned. The Taoist robes, the chanting, the incense——this had
to be a game of intimidation. The man was obviously taunting him, daring
him to walk into a trap. The game was so obvious that for one moment it
crossed Yi’s mind that Liang actually was alone, and desperate. But so
great was his fear of Liang that he dared not risk finding out. Such is the

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In 1841 the young P. T. Barnum, trying to establish his reputation as Amer-
ica&#x27;s premier showman, decided to purchase the American Museum in
Manhattan and turn it into a collection of curiosities that would secure his
fame. The problem was that he had no money. The museum’s asking price
was $15,000, but Barnum was able to put together a proposal that appealed
to the institution’s owners even though it replaced cash up front with
dozens of guarantees and references. The owners came to a verbal agree
ment with Barnum, but at the last minute, the principal partner changed
his mind, and the museum and its collection were sold to the directors of
Peale’s Museum. Barnum was infuriated, but the partner explained that
business was business——the museum had been sold to Pea1e’s because
Peale’s had a reputation and Barnum had none.

Barnum immediately decided that if he had no reputation to bank on,
his only recourse was to min the reputation of Peale’s. Accordingly he
launched a letter-writing campaign in the newspapers, calling the owners a
bunch of “broken-down bank directors” who had no idea how to run a mu-
seum or entertain people. He warned the public against buying Peale’s
stock, since the business’s purchase of another museum would invariably
spread its resources thin. The campaign was effective,
the stock plum-
meted, and with no more confidence in Pea.le’s track record and reputa-
tion, the owners of the American Museum reneged on their deal and sold
the whole thing to Barnum.

It took years for Pea.le’s to recover, and they never forgot what Bar-
num had done. Mr. Peale himself decided to attack Barnum by building a
reputation for “highbrow entertainment,” promoting his museum’s pro
grams as more scientific than those of his vulgar competitor. Mesmerism
(hypnotism) was one of Pea.le’s “scientific” attractions, and for a while it
drew big crowds and was quite successful. To fight back, Barnum decided
to attack Peale’s reputation yet again.

Barnum organized a rival mesmeric performance in which he himself
apparently put a little girl into a trance. Once she seemed to have fallen
deeply under, he tried to hypnotize members of the audience~—but no mat-
ter how hard he tried, none of the spectators fell under his spell, and many
of them began to laugh. A frustrated Barnum finally announced that to
prove the little girl’s trance was real, he would cut off one of her fingers

without her noticing. But as he sharpened the knife, the little girl’s eyes
popped open and she ran away, to the audience’s delight. He repeated this
and other parodies for several weeks. Soon no one could take Peale’s show
seriously, and attendance went way down. Within a few weeks, the show
closed. Over the next few years Bamum established a reputation for audac-
ity and consummate showtnanship that lasted his whole life. Pea1e’s reputa-
tion, on the other hand, never recovered.

Interpretation
Bamum used two different tactics to ruin Peale’s reputation. The first was
the museum’s stability and solvency.
simple: He sowed doubts about
Doubt is a powerful weapon: Once you let it out of the bag with insidious
rumors, your opponents are in a horrible dilemma. On the one hand they
can deny the rumors, even prove that you have slandered them. But a
layer of suspicion will remain: Why are they defending themselves so des-
perately? Maybe the rumor has some truth to it? If, on the other hand, they
take the high road and ignore you, the doubts, unrefuted, will be even
stronger. If done correctly, the sowing of rumors can so infuriate and unset-
tle your rivals that in defending themselves they will make numerous mis-
takes. This is the perfect weapon for those who have no reputation of their
own to work from.

Once Bamum did have a reputation of his own, he used the second,
gentler tactic, the fake hypnotism demonstration: He ridiculed his rivals’
reputation. This too was extremely successful. Once you have a solid base
of respect, ridiculing your opponent both puts him on the defensive and
draws more attention to you, enhancing your own reputation. Outright
slander and insult are too strong at this point; they are ugly, and may hurt
you more than help you. But gentle barbs and mockery suggest that you</pre>

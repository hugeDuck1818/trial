    <pre>An essential element in making this strategy work is to disguise your
like the strange enemy boats appearing
goal, shrouding it in mystery,
dimly in the mist. When your rivals cannot be sure what you are after, they
will reaxzt in ways that often work against them in the long run. In fact they
will become your ca3.’s-paws. If you disguise your intentions, it is much eas-
ier to guide them into moves that accomplish exactly what you want done,
but prefer not to do yourself. This may require planning several moves in
advance, like a billiard ball that bounces off the sides a few times before
heading into the right pocket;

The early-twentieth-century American con artist Yellow Kid Weil
knew that no matter how skillfully he horned in on the perfect wealthy
sucker, if he, a stranger, approached this man directly, the sucker might be-
come suspicious. So Weil would find someone the sucker already knew to
serve as a cat‘s—paw——-someone lower on the totem pole who was himself
an unlikely target, and would therefore be less suspicious. Weil would in-
terest this man in a scheme promising incredible wealth. Convinced the
scheme was for real, the cat’s—paw would often suggest, without prompting,
that his boss or wealthy friend should get involved: Having more cash to
invest, this man would increase the size of the pot. making bigger bucks for
all concerned. The cat‘s-paw would then involve the wealthy sucker who
had been Weil’-s target all along, but who would not suspect a trap, since it
was his trusty subordinate who had roped him in. Devices like this are
often the best way to approach a person of power: Use an associate or sub
ordinate to hook you up with your primary target. The cat’s-paw estalr
lishes your credibility and shields you from the unsavory appearance of
being too pushy in your courtship.

The easiest and most effective way to use a cat’s-paw is often to plant
information with him that he will then spread to your primary target. False
or planted information is a powerful tool, especially if spread by a dupe
whom no one suspects. You will find it very easy to play innocent and dis-
guise yourself as the source.

The strategic therapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson would often encounter
among his patients a married couple in which the wife Wanted the therapy
but the husband absolutely refused it Rather than wasting energy trying to
deal with the man directly, Dr. Erickson would see the wife alone, and as
she talked he would interject interpretations of the husband’s behavior that
he knew would rile the husband up if he heard them. Sure enough, the wife
would tell her husband what the doctor had said. After a few weeks the

Finally, you may well find cases in which deliberately offering yourself
as the cat’s-paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is the ruse of the
perfect courtier. Its symbol is Sir Walter Raleigh, who once placed his own
cloak on the muddy ground so that Queen Elizabeth would not sully her
shoes. As the instrument that protects a master or peer from unpleasant
ness or danger, you gain immense respect, which sooner or later will pay
dividends. And remember: If you can make your assistance subtle and gra—
cious rather than boastful and burdensome, your recompense will be that
much the more satisfying and powerful.

REVERSAI.
The cat’s~paw and the scapegoat must be used with extreme caution and
delicacy. They are like screens that hide your own involvement in dirty
work from the public; if at any moment the screen is lifted and you are
seen as the manipulator, the puppet master,
the whole dynamic aims
around—your hand will be seen everywhere, and you will be blamed for
misfortunes you may have had nothing to do with. Once the truth is re
vealed, events will snowball beyond your control.

In 1572, Queen Catherine de’ Médicis of France conspired to do away
with Gaspard de Coligny, an admiral in the French navy and a leading
member of the Huguenot (French Protestant) community. Coliguy was
close to Catherine’s son, Charles IX, and she feared his growing influence
on the young king. So she arranged for a member of the Guise family, one
of the most powerful royal clans in France, to assassinate him.

Secretly, however, Catherine had another plan: She Wanted the Hu-
guenots to blame the Guises for killing one of their leaders, and to take re
venge. With one blow, she would erase or injure two threatening rivals,
Coligny and the Guise family. Yet both plans went awry. The assassin
missed his target, only wounding Coligny; knowing Catherine as his
enemy, he strongly suspected it was she who had set up the attack on him,
and he told the king so. Eventually the failed assassination and the argu-
ments that ensued from it set off a chain of events that led to a bloody civil
war between Catholics and Protestants, culminating in the horrifying Mas
sacre of St. Bartholomew’s Eve, in which thousands of Protestants were
killed.

If you have to use a cat’s—paw or a scapegoat in an action of great con-
sequence, be very careful: Too much can go wrong. It is often wiser to use
such dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes or miscalculations
will cause no serious harm.

Finally, there are moments when it is advantageous to not disguise
your involvement or responsibility, but rather to take the blame yourself
for some mistake. If you have power and are secure in it, you should some
times play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you ask for forgiveness
from those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the king who makes a show of
his own sacrifices for the good of the people. Similarly, upon occasion you
may want to appear as the agent of punishment in order to instill fear and
trembling in your subordinates. Instead of the ca.t‘s~paw you show your
own mighty hand as a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If
you play it too often, fear will turn into resentment and hatred. Before you
know it, such emotions will spark a vigorous opposition that will someday
bring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat’s-paw——it is far safer.

THE SCIENCE OF Cl-IARLATANISM,
OR HOW TO CREATE A CULT lN FIVE EASY STEPS
In searching, as you must, for the methods that will gain you the most
power for the least effort, you will find the creation of a cultlike following
one of the most elfective. Having a large following opens up all sorts of
possibilities for deception; not only will your followers worship you, they
will defend you from your enemies and will voluntarily take on the work of
enticing others to join your fledgling cult. This kind of power will lift you to
another realm: You will no longer have to struggle or use subterfuge to en-
force your will. You are adored and can do no wrong.

You might think it a gargantuan task to create such a following, but in
fact it is fairly simple. As humans, we have a desperate need to believe in
something, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We simply cannot
endure long periods of doubt, or of the emptiness that comes from a lack of
something to believe in. Dangle in front of us some new cause, elixir, get-
rich-quick scheme, or the latest technological trend or art movement and
we leap from the water as one to take the bait. Look at history: The chroni-
cles of the new trends and cults that have made a mass following for them-
selves could fill a library. After a few centuries, a few decades, a few years,
a few months, they generally look ridiculous, but at the time they seem so
attractive, so transcendental, so divine.

Always in a rush to believe in something, we will manufacture saints
and faiths out of nothing. Do not let this gullibility go to waste: Make your»
self the object of worship. Make people form a cult around you.

The great European Charlatans of the sixteenth and seventeenth ten»
turies mastered the art of cultmaking. They lived, as we do now, in a time
of transformation: Organized religion was on the wane, science on the rise.
People were desperate to mlly around a new cause or faith. The Charlatans
had begun by peddling health elixirs and alchernic shortcuts to wealth.

groups—until, by accident,
The larger the group they gathered around themselves, the easier it was to
deceive.

The charlatan would station himself on a high wooden platform (hence
the term “mountebank”) and crowds would swarm around him. In a group
setting, people were more emotional, less able to reason. Had the charlatan
spoken to them individually, they might have found him ridiculous, but lost
in a crowd they got caught up in a communal mood of rapt attention. It be
came impossible for them to find the distance to be skeptical, Any deficien-
cies in the charlatan’s ideas were hidden by the zeal of the mass. Passion
and enthusiasm swept through the crowd like a contagion, and they reacted
violently to anyone who dared to spread a seed of doubt. Both consciously
studying this dynamic over decades of experiment and spontaneously
adapting to these situations as they happened, the charlatans perfected the
science of attracting and holding a crowd, molding the crowd into followers
and the followers into a cult.

LAW 27

The gimmicks of the Charlatans may seem quaint today, but there are
thousands of charlatans among us still, using the same tried~a:nd—true meth~
ods their predecessors refined centuries ago, only changing the names of
their elixirs and modernizing the look of their cults. We find these latter»
day charlatans in all arenas of life-~business, fashion, politics, art. Many of
them, perhaps, are following in the charlatan tradition without having any
knowledge of its history, but you can he more systematic and deliberate.
Simply follow the five steps of cultmaking that our charlatan ancestors per-
fected over the years.

Step 1: Keep It Vague; Keep It Simple. To create a cult you must first
attract attention. This you should do not through actions, which are too
clear and readable, but through words, which are hazy and deceptive. Your
initial speeches, conversations, and interviews must include two elements:
on the one hand the promise of something great and transformative, and
on the other a. total vagueness. This combination will stimulate all kinds of
hazy dreams in your listeners, who will make their own connections and
see what they want to see.

To make your vagueness attractive, use words of great resonance but
cloudy meaning, words full of heat and enthusiasm. Fancy titles for simple
things are helpful, as are the use of numbers and the creation of new words
for vague concepts. All of these create the impression of specialized knowl
edge, giving you a veneer of profunclity. By the same token, try to make the
subject of your cult new and fresh, so that few will understand it. Done right,
the combination of vague promises, cloudy‘ but alluring concepts, and fiery
enthusiasm will stir people’s souls and a group will form around you.

Talk :00 vaguely and you have no credibility. But it is more dangerous
to be specific. If you explain in detail the benefits people will gain by fol-
lowing your cult, you will be expected to satisfy them.

As a corollary to its vagueness your appeal should also be simple.
Most peop1e’s problems have complex causes: deep-rooted neurosis, inter
connected social factors, roots that go way back in time and are exceed-
ingly hard to unravel. Few, however, have the patience to deal with this;
most people want to hear that a simple solution will cure their problems.
The ability to offer this kind of solution will give you great power and build
you a following. Instead of the complicated explanations of real life, return
to the primitive solutions of our ancestors, to good old country remedies, to
mysterious panaceas.

Step 2: Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over the Intellectual.
Once people have begun to gather around you, two dangers will present
themselves: boredom and skepticism. Boredom will make people go else
where; skepticism will allow them the distance to think rationally about
whatever it is you are offering, blowing away the mist you have artfully cre-
ated and revealing your ideas for what they are. You need to arouse the
bored, then, and ward off the cynics.

The best way to do this is through theater, or other devices of its kind.
Surround yourself with luxury, dazzle your followers with visual splendor,
fill their eyes with spectacle. Not only will this keep them from seeing the
ridiculousness of your ideas, the holes in your belief system, it will also at-
tract more attention, more followers. Appeal to all the senses: Use incense
for scent, soothing music for hearing, colorful charts and graphs for the
eye. You might even tickle the mind, perhaps by using new technological
gadgets to give your cult a pseudo-scientific veneer-—as long as you do not
make anyone really think. Use the exotic—-distant cultures, strange cus-
toms—to create theatrical effects, and to make the most banal and ordinary
affairs seem signs of something extraordinary.

Step 3: Borrow the Forms of Organized Religion to Structure the
Group. Your cultlike following is growing; it is time to organize it. Find a
way both elevating and comforting. Organized religions have long held un-
questioned authority for large numbers of people, and continue to do so in
our supposedly secular age. And even if the religion itself has faded some,
its forms still resonate with power. The lofty and holy associations of orga-
nized religion can be endlessly exploited. Create rituals for your followers;
organize them into a hierarchy, ranking them in grades of sanctity, and giv-
ing them names and titles that resound with religious overtones; ask them
for sacrifices that will fill your coffers and increase your power. To empha-
size your gathering’s quasireligious nature, talk and act like a prophet. You
are not a dictator, after all; you are a priest, a guru, a sage, a shaman, or any
other word that hides your real power in the mist of religion.

Step 4: Disguise Your Source of Income. Your group has grown, and you
have structured it in a churchlike form. Your coffers are beginning to fill
with your followers’ money. Yet you must never be seen as hungry for
money and the power it brings. It is at this moment that you must disguise
the source of your income.

Your followers want to believe that if they follow you all sorts of good
things will fall into their lap. By surrounding yourself with luxury you be-
come living proof of the soundness of your belief system. Never reveal that
your wealth actually comes from your followers’ pockets; instead, make it
seem to come from the truth of your methods. Followers will copy your
each and every move in the belief that it will bring them the same results,
and their imitative enthusiasm will blind them to the charlatan nature of
your wealth.

Step 5: Set Up an Us-Versus—Them Dynamic. The group is new large
and thriving, a magnet attracting more and more particles. If you are not
careful, though, inertia will set in, and time and boredom will demagnetize
the group. To keep your followers united, you must now do what all reli-
gions and belief systems have done: create an us—versus—thern dynamic.

First, make sure your followers believe they are part of an exclusive

club, unified by a bond of common goals. Then, to strengthen this bond,
manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you. There is a
force of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you. Any outsider who
tries to reveal the charlatan nature of your belief system can now be de-
scribed as a member of this devious force.

If you have no enemies,

invent one. Given a straw man to react
against, your followers will tighten and cohere. They have your cause to
believe in and infidels to destroy.

OBSERVANCES OF ’l‘l.-i E LAW

Observance I
In the year 1653, a twenty»seven-ye-arclcl Milan man named Francesco
Giuseppe Borri claimed to have had a vision. He went around town telling
one and all that the archangel Michael had appeared to him and an-
nounced that he had been chosen to be the mpitano generale of the Army
of the New Pope, an army that would seize and revitalize the world.
The archangel had further revealed that Born‘ now had the power to see
people’s souls, and that he would soon discover the phi1osopher’s stone-a
longsought--after substance that could change base metals into gold.
Friends and acquaintances who heard Borri explain the vision, and who
witnessed the change that had come over him, were impressed, for Born‘
had previously devoted himself to a life of wine, women, and gambling.
Now he gave all that up, plunging himself into the study of alchemy and
talking only of mysticism and the occult.

The transformation was so sudden and miraculous, and Borri’s words
were so filled with enthusiasm, that he began to create a following. Unfor-
tunately the Italian Inquisition began to notice him as well—they prose-
cuted anyone who delved into the occult—so he left Italy and began to
wander Europe, from Ausuia to Holland, telling one and all that “to those
who follow me all joy shall be granted.” Wherever Borri stayed he at—
tracted followers. His method was simple: He spoke of his vision, which
had grown more and more elaborate, and offered to “look into” the soul of
anyone who believed him (and they were many). Seemingly in a trance, he
would stare at this new follower for several minutes, then claim to have
seen the person’s soul, degree of enlightenment, and potential for spiritual
greatness. If what he saw showed promise, he would add the person to his
growing order of disciples, an honor indeed.

The cult had six degrees, into which the disciples were assigned ac-
cording to what Borri had glimpsed in their souls. With work and total de
votion to the cult they could graduate to a higher degree. Borri-—-whom
they called “His Excellency,” and “Universal Doctor”--demanded from
them the strictest vows of poverty. All the goods and moneys they pos-
sessed had to be turned over to him. But they did not mind handing over
their property, for Borri had told them, “I shall soon bring my chemical

and by this means we shall all have as much gold as we desire.”

Given his growing wealth, Barri began to change his style of living.
Renting the most splendid apartment in the city into which he had tem-
porarily settled, he would furnish it with fabulous furniture and accessories,
which he had begun to collect. He would drive through the city in a coach
studded with jewels, with six magnificent black horses at its head. He never
stayed too long in one place, and when he disappeared, saying he had
more souls to gather into his flock, his reputation only grew in his absence.
He became famous, although in fact he had never done a single concrete
thing.

From all over Europe, the blind, the crippled, and the desperate came
to visit Borri, for word had spread that he had healing powers. He asked no
fee for his services, which only made him seem more marvelous, and in-
deed some claimed that in this or that city he had performed a miracle
cure. By only hinting at his accomplishments, he encouraged people’s
imaginations to blow them up to fantastic proportions. His wealth, for ex~
ample, actually came from the vast sums he was collecting from his in-
creasingly select group of rich disciples; yet it was presumed that he had in
fact perfected the philosopher’s stone. The Church continued to pursue
him, denouncing him for heresy and witchcraft, and Borzi’s response to
these charges was a dignified silence; this only enhanced his reputation and
made his followers more passionate. Only the great are persecuted, after
all; how many understood Jesus Christ in his own time? Born’ did not have
to say a word—-his followers now called the Pope the Antichrist.

And so Borri’s power grew and grew, until one day he left the city of
Amsterdam (where he had settled for a while), absconding with huge sums
of borrowed money and diamonds that had been entrusted to him. (He
claimed to be able to remove the flaws from diamonds through the power
of his gifted mind.) Now he was on the run. The Inquisition eventually
caught up with him, and for the last Menty years of his life he was impris-
oned in Rome. But so great was the belief in his occult powers that to his
dying day he was visited by wealthy believers, including Queen Christina
of Sweden. Supplying him udth money and materials,
these visitors al-
lowed him to continue his search for the elusive philosopher’s stone.
Interpretation
Before he formed his cult, Borri seems to have stumbled on a critical dis-
covery. Tiring of his life of debauchery, he had decided to give it up and to
devote himself to the occult, a genuine interest of his. He must have no
titted, however, that when he alluded to a mystical experience (rather than
physical exhaustion) as the source of his conversion, people of all classes
wanted to hear more. Realizing the power he could gain by ascxibing the
change to something external and mysterious, he went further with his
manufactured visions. The grander the vision, and the more sacrifices he
asked for, the more appealing and believable his story seemed to become.

Observance II
In the mid-17005, word spread in Europe’s fashionable society of a Swiss
country doctor named Michael Schiippach who practiced a different kind
of medicine: He used the healing powers of nature to perform miraculous
cures. Soon well-to—do people from all over the Continent, their ailments
both serious and mild, were making the trek to the alpine village of Lang-
nau, where Schiippach lived and worked. Trudging through the mountains,
these visitors witnessed the most dramatic natural landscapes that Europe
has to offer. By the time they reached Langnau, they were already feeling
transformed and on their way to health.

Schiippach, who had become known as simply the “Mountain Doc-
tor,” had a small pharmacy in town. This place became quite a scene:
Crowds of people from many different countries would cram the small
room, its walls lined with colorful bottles filled with herbal cures. Where
most doctors of the time prescribed foul-tasting concoctions that bore in-
comprehensible Latin titles (as medicines often do still), Schiippaclfs cures
had names such as “The Oil of joy,” “Little Flower’s Heart,” or “Against
the Monster,” and they tasted sweet and pleasing.

Visitors to Langnau would have to wait patiently for a visit with the
Mountain Doctor, because every day some eighty messengers would arrive
at the pharmacy bearing flasks of urine from all over Europe. Schiippach
claimed he could diagnose what ailed you simply by looking at a sample of
your mine and reading a written description of your ailment. (Naturally he
read the description very carefully before prescribing a cure.) When he fl»
nally had a spare minute (the urine samples took up much of his time), he
would call the visitor into his office in the pharmacy. He would then exam-
ine this person’s urine sample, explaining that its appearance would tell
him everything he needed to know. Country people had a sense for these
things, he would say——their wisdom came from living a simple, godly life
with none of the complications of urban living. This personal consultation
would also include a discussion as to how one might bring one’s soul more
into harmony with nature.

Schiippach had devised many forms of treatment, each profoundly un~
like the usual medical practices of the time. He was a believer, for instance,
in electric shock therapy. To those who wondered whether this was in
keeping with his belief in the healing power of nature, he would explain
that electricity is a natural phenomenon; he was merely imitating the

power of lightning. One of his patients claimed to be inhabited by seven
devils. The doctor cured him with electrical shocks, and as he administered
these he exclaimed that he could see the devils flying out of the man’s
body, one by one. Another man claimed to have swallowed a hay wagon
and its driver, which were causing him massive pains in the chest. The
Mountain Doctor listened patiently, claimed to be able to hear the crack of
a whip in the man’s belly, promised to cure him, and gave him a sedative
and a purgative. The man fell asleep on a chair outside the pharmacy. As
soon as he awoke he vomited, and as he vomited a hay wagon sped past
him (the Mountain Doctor had hired it for the occasion), the crack of its
whip making him feel that somehow he had indeed expelled it under the
doctor’s care.

Over the years, the Mountain Doctor’s fame grew. He was consulted
by the powerful—-—even the writer Goethe made the trek to his village——and
he became the center of a cult of nature in which everything natural was
considered worthy of worship. Schiippach was careful to create effects that
would entertain and inspire his patients. A professor who visited him once
wrote, “One stands or sits in company, one plays cards, sometimes with a
young woman; now a concert is given, now a lunch or supper, and now a
little ballet is presented. With a very happy effect, the freedom of nature is
everywhere united with the pleasures of the beau monde, and if the doctor
is not able to heal any diseases, he can at least cure hypochondria and the
vapors.”
Interpretation
Schiippach had begun his career as an ordinary village doctor. He would
sometimes use in his practice some of the village remedies be had grown
up with, and apparently he noticed some results, for soon these herbal tinc-
tures and natural forms of healing became his specialty. And in fact his nat—
form of healing did have profound psychological effects on his
ural
patients. Where the normal drugs of the time created fear and pain, Schiip—
pach’s treatments were comfortable and soothing. The resulting unprove-
ment in the patients mood was a critical element in the cures he brought
about. His patients believed so deeply in his skills that they willed them-
selves into health. Instead of scoffing at their irrational explanations for
their ailments, Schiippach used their hypochondria to make it seem that he
had effected a great cure.

The caseof the Mountain Doctor teaches us valuable lessons in the
creation of a cultlike following. First, you must End a. way to engage peo-
ple’s will, to make their belief in your powers strong enough that they
imagine all sorts of benefits. Their belief will have a self—fullilling quality,
but you must make sure that it is you, rather than their own will, who is
seen as the agent of nransformaiion. Find the belief, cause, or fantasy that
will make them believe with a passion and they will imagine the rest, wor«
shipping you as healer, prophet, genius, whatever you like.

Second, Schlippach teaches us the everlasting power of belief in na-
ture, and in simplicity. Nature, in reality, is full of much that is terrifying-
poisonous plants, fierce animals, sudden disasters, plagues. Belief in the

healing, comforting quality of nature is really a constructed myth, a roman«
ticism. But the appeal to nature can bring you great power, especially in
complicated and stressful times.

This appeal, however, must be handled right. Devise a kind of theater
of nature in which you, as the director, pick and choose the qualities that lit
the romanticism of the times. The Mountain Doctor played the part to per-
fection, playing up his homespun wisdom and wit, and staging his cures as
dramatic pieces. He did not make himself one with nature; instead he
molded nature into a cult, an artificial construction, To create a “natural”
effect you actually have to work hard, making nature theatrical and de-
lightfully pagan. Otherwise no one will notice. Nature too must follow
trends and be progressive.

Observance III
In 1788, at the age of fifty-five, the doctor and scientist Franz Mesmer was
at a crossroads. He was a pioneer in the study of animal magnetism-the
belief that animals contain magnetic matter, and that a doctor or specialist
can effect miraculous cures by working on this charged substam:e—but in
Vienna, where he lived, his theories had met with scorn and ridicule from
the medical establishment. In treating women for convulsions, Mesmer
claimed to have worked a number of cures, his proudest achievement
being the restoration of sight to a blind girl. But. another doctor who exam-
ined the young girl said she was as blind as ever, an assessment with which
she herself agreed. Mesmer countered that his enemies were out to slander
him by winning her over to their side. This claim only elicited more
ridicule. Clearly the sober-minded Viennese were the wrong audience for
his theories, and so he decided to move to Paris and start again.

Renting a splendid apartment in his new city, Mesmer decorated it ap~
propriately. Stained glass in most of the windows created a religious feel-
ing, and mirrors on all the walls produced an hypnotic effect The doctor
advertised that in his apartment he would give demonstrations of the pow-
ers of animal magnetism, inviting the diseased and melancholic to feel its
powers. Soon Parisians of all classes (but mostly women, who seemed more
attracted to the idea than men did) were paying for entry to witness the
miracles that Mesmer promised.

Inside the apartment, the scents of orange blossom and exotic incense
wafted through special vents. As the initiates filtered into the salon where
they heard harp music and the lulling
the demonstrations took place,
sounds of a female vocalist coming from another room. In the center of the
salon was a long oval container filled with water that Mesmer claimed had
been magnetized. From holes in the conta.iner’s metal lid protruded long
movable iron rods. The visitors were instructed to sit around the container,
place these magnetized rods on the body part that gave them pains or
problems, and then hold hands with their neighbors, sitting as close as pos-
sible to one another to help the magnetic force pass between their bodies.
Sometimes, too, they were attached to each other by cords.

Mesmer would leave the room, and “assistant rnagnetizers”—-—a.ll hand»

some and strapping young men—would enter with jars of magnetized
water that they would sprinkle on the patients, rubbing the healing fluid on
their bodies, massaging it into their skin, moving them toward a trancelike
state. And after a few minutes a kind of delirium would overcome the
women. Some would sob, some would shriek and bear their hair, others
would laugh hysterically. At the height of the delirium Mesmer would
reenter the salon, dressed in a flowing silk robe embroidered with golden
flowers and carrying a white magnetic rod. Moving around the container,
he would stroke and soothe the patients until calm was restored. Many
women would later attribute the strange power he had on them to his
piercing look, which, they thought, was exciting or quieting the magnetic
fluids in their bodies.

Within months of his arrival in Paris, Mesmer became the rage. His
supporters included Marie—Antoinette herself, the queen of France, wife of
Louis XVI. As in Vienna, he was condemned by the official faculty of med-
icine, but it did not matter. His growing following of pupils and patients
paid him handsomely.

Mesmer expanded his theories to proclaim that all humanity could be
brought into harmony through the power of magnetism, a concept with
much appeal during the French Revolution. A cult of Mesrnerism spread
across the country; in many towns, “Societies of Harmony” sprang up to
experiment with magnetism. These societies eventually became notorious:
They tended to be led by libertines who would turn their sessions into a
kind of group orgy.

At the height of Mesmer‘s popularity, a French commission published
a report based on years of testing the theory of animal magnetism. The
conclusion: Magneu&#x27;sm’s effects on the body actually came from a kind of
group hysteria and autosuggestion. The report was well documented, and
mined Mesmer’s reputation in France. He left the country and went into
retirement. Only a few years later, however, imitators sprang up all over
Europe and the cult of Mesmerism spread once again, its believers more
numerous than ever.

Interpretation
Mesmer’s career can be broken into two parts. When still in Vienna, he
clearly believed in the validity of his theory, and did all he could to prove
it. But his growing frustration and the disapproval of his colleagues made
him adopt another strategy. First he moved to Paris, where no one knew
him, and where his extravagant theories found a more fruitful soil. Then he
appealed to the French love of theater and spectacle, making his apartment
into a kind of magical world in which a sensory overload of smells, sights,
and sounds entranced his customers. Most important, from now on he
practiced his magnetism only on a group. The group provided the setting
in which the magnetism would have its proper effect, one believer infecting
the other, overwhelming any individual doubter.

Mesmer thus passed from being a confirmed advocate of magnetism
tn the role of a charlatan using every trick in the book to captivate the pub-

lie. The biggest trick of all was to play on the repressed sexuality that bub-
bles under the surface of any group setting. In a group, a longing for social
unity, a longing older than civilization, cries out to be awakened. This de~
sire may be subsumed under a unifying cause, but beneath it is a repressed
sexuality that the charlatan knows how to exploit and manipulate for his
own purposes.

This is the lesson that Mesmer teaches us: Our tendency to doubt, the
distance that allows us to reason, is broken down when we join a group.
The warmth and infectiousness of the group overwhelm the skeptical indi-
vidual. This is the power you gain by creating a cult. Also, by playing on
people’s repressed sexuality, you lead them into mistaking their excited
feelings for signs of your mystical strength. You gain untold power by
working on people’s unrealized desire for a. kind of promiscuous and
pagan unity.

Remember too that the most effective cults mix religion with science.
Take the latest technological trend or fad and blend it with a noble cause, a
mystical faith, a new form of healing. People’s interpretations of your hy—
brid cult will run rampant, and they will attribute powers to you that you
had never even thought to claim.

Image: The Magnet. /in unseen force draws objects to it,

increasing. But take away the original magnet and it all falls
the invisible force that attracts

people’s imaginations and holds them together. Once they
have Clustered around you, no power can wrest them away.

Authority: The charlatan achieves his great power by simply opening
a possibility for men to believe what they already want to believe. .
The credulous cannot keep at a distance; they crowd around the
wonder worker, entering his personal aura, surrendering themselves
to illusion with a heavy solemnity, like cattle. (Grete de Francesco)

LAW 27

R EVE RSAL
One reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to deceive
than an individual, and turns over to you that much more power. This
comes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the group sees through
you, you will find yourself facing not one deceived Soul but an angry crowd
that will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once followed you. The Charlatans
constantly faced this danger, and were always ready to move out of town as
it inevitably became clear that their elixirs did not work and their ideas
were sham. Too slow and they paid with their lives. In playing with the
crowd, you are playing with fire, and must constantly keep an eye out for
any sparks of doubt, any enemies who will turn the crowd against you.
When you play with the emotions of a crowd, you have to know how to
adapt, attuning yourself instantaneously to all of the moods and desires that
a group will produce. Use spies, be on top of everything, and keep your
bags packed.

For this reason you may often prefer to deal with people one by one.
Isolating them from their normal milieu can have the same effect as putting
them in a group—it makes them more prone to suggestion and intimida-
tion. Choose the right sucker and if he eventually sees through you he may
prove easier to escape than a crowd.

ENTER ACTION

WITH BOLDNESS

JUD G M ENT
Ifyou are unsure ofa course ofactian, do not attempt it.
Your doubts and hesitatimzs will in/eat your execution.
Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any
mistakes you commit
thmugh audacity are easily cor-
rected with more audacity. Everyone admires the hold; no
one honors the timid.

BOl.l)NF.SS AND HESITATION: A Brief Psychological Comparison
Boldness and hesitation elicit very different psychological responses in their
targets: Hesitalion puts obstacles in your path, boldness eliminates them.
Once you understand this, you will find it essential to overcome your nat-
ural timidity and practice the art of audacity. The following are among the
most pronounced psychological efiects of boldness and tirnidity.

The Bolder the Lie the Better. We all have weaknesses, and our efforts
are never perfect. But entering action with boldness has the magical effect
of hiding our deficiencies. Con artists know that the bolder the lie, the
more convincing it becomes. The sheer audacity of the story makes it more
credible, distracting attention from its inconsistencies When putting to-
gether a con or entering any kind of negotiation, go further than you
planned. Ask for the moon and you will be surprised how often you get it.

Lions Circle the Hesitant Prey. People have a sixth sense for the weak-
nesses of others. If, in a first encounter, you demonstrate your willingness
to compromise, back down, and retreat, you bring out the lion even in peo-
ple who are not necessarily bloodthirsty. Everything depends on percep-
tion, and once you are seen as the kind of person who quickly goes on the
defensive, who is willing to negotiate and be amenable, you will be pushed
around without mercy.

Boldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Authority. The bold move makes
you seem larger and more powerful than you are. If it comes suddenly,
with the stealth and swiftness of a snake, it inspires that much more fear. By
intimidating with a bold move, you establish a precedent: in every subse-
quent encounter, people will be on the defensive, in terror of your next
strike.

Going Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the Deeper Grave. If you
enter an action with less than total confidence, you set up obstacles in your
own path. When a problem arises you will grow confused, seeing options
where there are none and inadvertently creating more problems still. Re-
treating from the hunter, the timid hare scurries more easily into his snares.

Hesitation Creates Gaps, Boldness Obliterates Them. When you take
time to think, to hem and haw, you create a gap that allows others time to
think as well. Your timidity infects people with awkward energy, elicits em-
barrassment. Doubt springs up on all sides.

Boldness destroys such gaps. The swiftness of the move and the energy
of the action leave others no space to doubt and worry. In seduction, hesi-
tation is fatal—it makes your victim conscious of your intentions. The bold
move crowns seduction with triumph: It leaves no time for reflection.

Audacity Separates You from the Herd. Boldness gives you presence
and makes you seem larger than life. The timid fade into the wallpaper, the

OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW

Observance I
In May of 1925, five of the most successful dealers in the French scrap
metal business found themselves invited to an “official” but “highly confi-
dential” meeting with the deputy director general of the Ministry of Post
and Telegraphs at the Hotel Criilon, then the most luxurious hotel in Paris.
When the businessmen arrived, it was the director general himself, a Mon-
sieur Lustig, who met them in a swank suite on the top floor.

The businessmen had no idea why they had been summoned to this
meeting, and they were bursting with curiosity. After drinks, the director
explained. “Gentlemen,” he said, “this is an urgent matter that requires
complete secrecy. The government is going to have to tear down the Eiffel
Tower.” The dealers listened in stunned silence as the director explained
that the tower, as recently reported in the news, desperately needed re
pairs. It had originally been meant as a temporary structure (for the Expo»
sition of 1889), its maintenance costs had soared over the years, and now,
in a time of a fiscal crisis, the government would have to spend millions to
fix it. Many Parlsians considered the Eiffel Tower an eyesore and would be
delighted to see it go. Over time, even the tourists would forget about it—it
would live on in photographs and postcards. “Gentlemen,” Lustig said,
“you are all invited to make the government an offer for the Eiffel Tower.”
He gave the businessmen sheets of government stationery filled with
figures, such as the tonnage of the tower’s metal. Their eyes popped as they
calculated how much they could make from the scrap. Then Lustig led
them to a waiting limo, which brought them to the Eiffel Tower. Flashing
an official badge, he guided them through the area, spicing his tour with
amusing anecdotes. At the end of the visit be thanked them and asked
them to have their offers delivered to his suite within four days.

Several days after the offers were submitted, one of the five, a Mon-
sieur P., received notice that his bid was the winner, and that to secure the
sale he should come to the suite at the hotel within two days, bearing a cer-
tified check for more than 250,000 francs (the equivalent today of about
$1,000,000)--—a quarter of the total price. On delivery of the check, he
would receive the documents confirming his ownership of the Eiffel Tower.
Monsieur P. was excited—-he would go down in history as the man who
had bought and torn down the infamous landmark. But by the time he ar-
rived at the suite, check in hand, he was beginning to have doubts about
the whole affair. Why meet in a hotel instead of a government building?
Why hadrft he heard from other offieials? Was this a hoax, a scam? As he
listened to Lustig discuss the arrangements for the scrapping of the tower,
he hesitated, and contemplated backing out.

Suddenly, however, he realized that the director had changed his tone.
Instead of talking about the tower, he was complaining about his low
salary, about his wife’s desire for a fur coat, about how galling it was to
work hard and be unappreciated. It dawned on Monsieur P. that this high
government official was asking for a bribe. The effect on him, though, was
not outrage but relief. Now he was sure that Lustig was for real, since in all
of his previous encounters with French bureaucrats, they had inevitably
asked for a little greasing of the palm. His confidence restored, Monsieur P.
slipped the director several thousand francs in bills, then handed him the
certified check. In return he received the documentation, including an im-
pressive—looking bill of sale. He left the hotel, dreaming of the profits and
fame to come.

Over the next few days, however, as Monsieur P. waited for corre-
spondence from the government, he began to realize that something was
amiss. A few telephone calls made it clear that there was no deputy direc-
tor general Lustig, and there were no plans to destroy the Eiffel Tower: He
had been bilked of over 250,000 francs!

Monsieur P. never went to the police. He knew what kind of reputa-
tion he would get if word got out that he had fallen for one of the most ab
surdly audacious cons in history. Besides the public humiliation, it would
have been business suicide.

Interpretation
Had Count Victor Lustig, con artist extraordinaire, tried to sell the Arc de
Triomphe, a bridge over the Seine, a statue of Balzac, no one would have
believed him. But the Eiffel Tower was just too large, too improbable to be
part of a con job. In fact it was so improbable that Lustig was able to return
to Paris six months later and “resell” the Eiffel Tower to a different scrap-
iron dealer, and for a higher price-—a sum in francs equivalent today to
over $1,500,000!

Largeness of scale deceives the human eye. It distracts and awes us,
and is so self-evident that we carmot imagine there is any illusion or decep-
tion afoot. Arm yourself with bigness and boldness—stretch your decep-
tions as far as they will go and then go further. If you sense that the sucker
has suspicions, do as the intrepid Lustig did: Instead of backing down, or
lowering his price, he simply raised his price higher, by asking for and get-
ting a bribe. Asking for more puts the other person on the defensive, cuts
out the nibbling effect of compromise and doubt, and overwhelms with its
boldness.

of a semi-united Russia, proclaimed his three-year-old son, Ivan IV, as his

boyars would be able to roll back the dukes’ gains, wrest control of the
state. and humiliate the royal family.

Aware of these dangers, young Helena tumecl to her trusted friend
Prince Ivan Obolensky to help her rule. But after five years as regent she
suddenly died——poisoned by a member of the Shuisky family, the most
fearsome boyar clan. The Shuisky princes seized control of the govern-
ment and threw Obolensky in prison, where he starved to death. At the age
of eight, Ivan was now a despised orphan, and any boyar or family mem-
ber who took an interest in him was immediately banished or killed.

And so Ivan roamed the palace, hungry, ill clothed, and often in bid
ing from the Shuiskys, who treated him roughly when they saw him. On
some days they would search him out, clothe him in royal robes, hand him
a. scepter, and set him on the throne——a kind of mock ritual in which they
lampooned his royal pretensions. Then they would shoo him away. One
evening several of them chased the Metropolitan———the head of the Russian
chu;rch—through the palace, and he sought refuge in Ivan’s room; the boy
watched in horror as the Shuiskys entered, hurled insults, and beat the
Metropolitan mercilessly.

Ivan had one friend in the palace, a boyar named Vorontsov who con»
soled and advised him. One day, however, as he, Vorontsov, and the
newest Metropolitan conferred in the palace refectory, several Shuiskys
burst in, heat up Vorontsov, and insulted the Metropolitan by hearing and
treading on his robes. Then they banished Vorontsov from Moscow.

Throughout all this Ivan maintained a strict silence. To the boyars it
seemed that their plan had worked: The young man had turned into a ter-
rified and obedient idiot. They could ignore him now, even leave him
alone. But on the evening of December 29, I543, Ivan, now thirteen, asked
Prince Andrei Shuisky to come to his room. When the prince arrived, the
room was filled with palace guards. Young Ivan then pointed his finger at
Andrei and ordered the guards to arrest him, have him killed, and throw
his body to the bloodhounds in the royal kennel. Over the next few days
Ivan had all of Andrei’s close associates arrested and banished. Caught off—
guard by his sudden boldness, the boyars now stood in mortal terror of this
youth, the future Ivan the Terrible, who had planned and waited for five
years to execute this one swift and bold act that would secure his power for
decades to come.

Interpretation
The world is full of boyars--men who despise you, fear your ambition, and
jealously guard their shrinking realms of power. You need to establish your
authority and gain respect, but the moment the boyars sense your growing
boldness, they will act to thwart you. This is how Ivan met such a situation:
He lay low, showing neither ambition nor discontent. He waited, and when
the time came he brought the palace guards over to his side. The guards
had come to hate the cruel Shuiskys. Once they agreed to Ivan’s plan, he
struck with the swiftness of a snake, pointing his finger at Shuisky and giv-
ing him no time to react

Observance lll
In 1514 the twenty—two-year-old Pietro Aretino was working as a lowly as-
sistant scullion to a wealthy Roman family. He had ambitions of greatness
as a writer, to enflame the world with his name, but how could a mere
lackey hope to realize such dreams?

That year Pope Leo X received from the king of Portugal an embassy
that included many gifts, most prominent among them a great elephant,
the first in Rome since imperial times. The ponhff adored this elephant and
showered it with attention and gifts. But despite his love and care, the ele
pliant, which was called Hanna, became deathly ill. The pope summoned
doctors, who administered a five—hundred-pound purgative to the ele
pliant, but all to no avail. The animal died and the pope went into mourn-
ing. To console himself he summoned the great painter Raphael and
ordered him to create a life-sized painting of Hanno above the animals
tomb, bearing the inscription, “What nature took away, Raphael has with
his art restored.”

Over the next few days, a pamphlet circulated throughout Rome that
caused great niernment and laughter. Entitled “The Last Will and Testa-
ment of the Elephant Hanna,” it read, in part, “To my heir the Cardinal
Santa Croce, I give my knees, so that he can imitate my genuilections. .
To my heir Cardinal Santi Quattro, I give my jaws, so that he can more
. To my heir Cardinal Medici, I
readily devour all of Christ’s revenues. .
. .” To Cardinal
give my ears, so that he can hear everyone’s doings.
Grassi, who had a reputation for lechery, the elephant bequeathed the ap
propriate, oversized part of his own anatomy.

.

.

.

.

On and on the anonymous pamphlet went, sparing none of the great
in Rome, not even the pope. With each one it took aim at their best—known
weakness. The pamphlet ended with verse, “See to it that Aretino is your
friend / For he is a bad enemy to have. I His words alone could ruin the
high pope / So God guard everyone from his tongue.”
Interpretation
With one short pamphlet, Aretino, son of a poor shoemaker and a servant
himself, hurled himself to fame. Everyone in Rome rushed to find out who
this daring young man was. Even the pope, amused by his audacity, sought
him out and ended up giving him a job in the papal service. Over the years
he came to be known as the “Scourge of Princes,” and his biting tongue
earned him the respect and fear of the great, from the king of France to the
Hapsburg emperor.

The Aretino strategy is simple: When you are as small and obscure as
David was, you must find a Goliath to attack. The larger the target, the
more attention you gain. The bolder the attack, the more you stand out

from the crowd, and the more admiration you eam. Society is full of those
who think daring thoughts but lack the guts to print and publicize them.
Voice what the public feels--the expression of shared feelings is always
powerful. Search out the most prominent target possible and sling your
boldest shot. The world will enjoy the spectacle, and will honor the under-
dog—you, that is-—with glory and power.

KEYS TO POWER

Most of us are timid. We want to avoid tension and conflict and we want to
be liked by all. We may contemplate a bold action but we rarely bring it to
life. We are terrified of the consequences, of what others might think of us,
of the hostility we will stir up if we dare go beyond our usual place.

Although we may disguise our timidity as a concern for others, a de-
sire not to hurt or offend them, in fact it is the opposite—we are really self-
absorbed, worried about ourselves and how others perceive us. Boldness,
on the other hand, is outer-directed, and often makes people feel more at
ease, since it is less self-conscious and less repressed.

This can be seen most clearly in seduction. All great seducers succeed
through effrontery. Casanova’s boldness was not revealed in a daring ap-
proach to the woman he desired, or in intrepid words to flatter her; it con-
sisted in his ability to surrender himself to her completely and to make her
believe he would do anything for her, even risk his life, which in fact he
sometimes did. The woman on whom he lavished this attention under-
stood that he held nothing back from her. This was infinitely more flatter-
ing than compliments. At no point during the seduction would he show
hesitation or doubt, simply because he never felt it.

Part of the charm of being seduced is that it makes us feel engulfed,
temporarily outside of ourselves and the usual doubts that permeate our
lives. The moment the seducer hesitates, the charm is broken, because we
become aware of the process, of their deliberate effort to seduce us, of
their self-consciousness. Boldness directs attention outward and keeps
the illusion alive. It never induces awkwardness or embarrassment. And
so we admire the bold, and prefer to be around them, because their self-
confidence infects us and draws us outside our own realm of inwardness

and reflection.

Few are born bold. Even Napoleon had to cultivate the habit on the
battlefield, where he knew it was a matter of life and death. In social set
tings he was awkward and timid, but he overcame this and practiced bold-
ness in every part of his life because he saw its tremendous power, how it
could literally enlarge it man (even one who, like Napoleon, was in fact
conspicuously small). We also see this change in Ivan the Terrible: A harm-
less boy suddenly transforms himself into a powerful young man who com-
mands authority, simply by pointing a finger and taking hold action.

You must practice and develop your boldness. You will often find uses
for it. The best place to begin is often the delicate world of negotiation, par-

ticularly those discussions in which you are asked to set your own price.
How ofien we put ourselves down by asking for too little. When Christa
pher Columbus proposed that the Spanish court finance his voyage to the
Americas, he also made the insanely bold demand that he be called
“Grand Admiral of the Ocean.” The court agreed. The price he set was the
price he received--he demanded to be treated with respect, and so he was.
Henry Kissinger too knew that in negotiation, bold demands work better
than starting off with piecemeal concessions and trying to meet the other
person halfway. Set your value high, and then, as Count Lusfig did, set it
higher.

~

Understand: If boldness is not natural, neither is timidity. It is an ac-
quired habit, picked up out of a. desire to avoid conflict. If timidity has
taken hold of you, then, root it out Your fears of the consequences of a
bold action are way out of proportion to reality, and in fact the conse
quences of timidity are worse. Your value is lowered and you create a self~
fulfilling cycle of doubt and disaster. Remember: The problems created by
an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater
audacity.

Image: The Lion and the
Hare. The lion creates no
gaps in his way——his
movements are too

swift, hisjaws too quick
and powerful. The
timid hare will do any-
thing to escape danger,
but in its haste to

retreat and flee, it backs
into traps, hops smack
into its enemies’ jaws.

Authority: I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than
cautious, for fortune is a woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to
master her, to conquer her by force; and it can be seen that she lets
herself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who proceed
like a woman, she is always a friend to
coldly. And therefore,
the young, because they are less cautious,
fiercer, and master
her with greater audacity. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

REVE RS/\L
Boldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions. It is a tac-
tical instrument, to be used at the right moment. Plan and think ahead, and
make the final element the bold move that will bring you success. In other
words, since boldness is a learned response, it is also one that you leam to
control and utilize at will. To go through life armed only with audacity
would be tiring and also fatal. You would offend too many people, as is
proven by those who cannot control their boldness, One such person was
Lola Montez; her audacity brought her triumphs and led to her seduction
of the king of Baxfatia. But since she could never rein in her boldness, it
also led to her downfall—-in Bavaria, in England, wherever she turned. It
crossed the border between boldness and the appearance of cruelty, even
insanity. Ivan the Terrible suffered the same fate: When the power of bold-
ness brought him success, he stuck to it, to the point where it became a life
long pattern of violence and sadism. He lost the ability to tell when
boldness was appropriate and when it was not.

Timidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often benefit,
however, by being able to feign it. At that point, of course, it is no longer
iimidity but an offensive weapon: You are luring people in with your show
of shyness, all the better to pounce on them boldly later.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In 1510 a ship set out from the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the
Dominican Republic) for Venezuela, where it was to rescue a besieged
Spanish colony. Several miles out of port, a stowaway climbed out of a
provision chest: Vasco Nufiez de Balboa, a noble Spaniard who had come
to the New World in search of gold but had fallen into debt and had es-
taped his creditors by hiding in the chest.

Balboa had been obsessed with gold ever since Columbus had re-
turned to Spain from his voyages with tales of a fabulous but as yet undis-
covered kingdom called El Dorado. Balboa was one of
the first
adventurers to come in search of Colurnbus’s land of gold, and he had de-
cided from the beginning that he would be the one to find it, through
sheer audacity and single—mindedness. Now that he was free of his credi-
tors, nothing would stop him.

Unfortunately the ship’s owner, a wealthy jurist named Francisco Fer-
nandez de Enciso, was furious when told of the stowaway, and he ordered
that Balboa be left on the first island they came across. Before they found
any island, however, Enciso received news that the colony he was to res-
cue had been abandoned. This was Balboa’s chance. He told the sailors of
his previous voyages to Panarna, and of the rumors he had heard of gold
in the area. The excited sailors convinced Enciso to spare Balboa’s life,
and to establish a colony in Panama. Weeks later they named their new
settlement “Darien.”

Darien’s first governor was Enciso, but Balboa was not a man to let
the initiative. He campaigned against Enciso among the
others steal
sailors, who eventually made it clear that they preferred him as governor.
Enciso fled to Spain, fearing for his life. Months later, when a representa-
tive of the Spanish crown arrived to establish himself as the new, official
governor of Darien, he was turned away. On his return voyage to Spain,
this man drowned; the drowning was accidental, but under Spanish law,
Balboa had murdered the governor and usurped his position.

Balb0a’s bravado had got him out of scrapes before, but now his
hopes of wealth and glory seemed doomed. To lay claim to El Dorado,
should he discover it, he would need the approval of the Spanish king-—
which, as an outlaw, he would never receive. There was only one solution.
Panamanian Indians had told Balboa of a vast ocean on the other side of
the Central American isthmus, and had said diat by traveling south upon
this western coast, he would reach a fabulous land of gold, called by a
name that to his ears sounded like “Biru.” Balboa decided he would cross
the treacherous jungles of Panama and become the first European to bathe
his feet in this new ocean. From there he would march on El Dorado. If he
did this on Spain’s behalf, he would obtain the eternal gratitude of the
king, and would secure his own reprieve—-only he had to act before Span-
ish authorities came to arrest him.

In 1513, then, Balboa set out, with 190 soldiers. Halfway across the
isthmus (some ninety miles wide at that point), only sixty soldiers re-

mained, many having succumbed to the harsh conditions——the blood-
sucking insects, the torrential rainfall, fever. Finally, from a mountaintop,
Balboa became the first European to lay eyes on the Pacific Ocean. Days
later he marched in his armor into its waters, bearing the banner of Castile
lands, and islands in the name of the Spanish
and claiming all its seas,
throne.

Indians from the area greeted Balboa with gold, jewels, and precious
pearls, the like of which he had never seen. When he asked where these
had come from, the Indians pointed south, to the land of the Incas. But
Balboa had only a few soldiers left. For the moment, he decided, he
should return to Darien, send the jewels and gold to Spain as a token
of good will, and ask for a large army to aid him in the conquest of El
Dorado.

When news reached Spain of Balboa’s bold crossing of the isthmus,
his discovery of the western ocean, and his planned conquest of El Do-
rado, the former criminal became a hero. He was instantly proclaimed
governor of the new land. But before the king and queen received word of
his discovery, they had already sent a dozen ships, under the command of
a man named Pedro Arias Davila, “Pedrarias,” with orders to arrest Bal-
boa for murder and to take command of the colony. By the time Pedrarias
arrived in Panama, he had learned that Balboa had been pardoned, and
that he was to share the governorship with the former outlaw.

All the same, Balboa felt uneasy. Gold was his dream, El Dorado his
only desire. In pursuit of this goal he had nearly died many times over,
and to share the wealth and glory with a newcomer would be intolerable.
He also soon discovered that Pedraxias was a jealous, bitter man, and
equally unhappy with the situation. Once again, the only solution for Bel»
boa was to seize the initiative by proposing to cross the jungle with a
larger army, carrying shipbuilding materials and tools. Once on the Pa—
cific coast, he would create an armada. with which to conquer the Incas.
Surprisingly enough, Pedrarias agreed to the plan—--perhaps sensing it
would never work. Hundreds died in this second march through the jun-
gle, and the timber they carried rotted in the torrential rains. Balboa, as
usual, was undaunted»-no power in the world could thwart his plan—and
on arriving at the Pacific he began to cut down trees for new lumber. But
the men remaining to him were too few and too weak to mount an inva-
sion, and once again Balboa had to return to Darien.

Pedrarias had in any case invited Balboa back to discuss a new plan,
and on the outskirts of the settlement, the explorer was met by Francisco
Pizarro, an old friend who had accompanied him on his first crossing of
the isthmus. But this was a trap: Leading one hundred soldiers, Pizarro
surrounded his former friend, arrested him, and returned him to Fe
draiias, who tried him on charges of rebellion. A few days later Ba.lboa’s
head fell
into a basket, along with those of his most trusted followers.
Years later Pizarro himself reached Peru, and Balboa’s deeds were for-
gotten.

Interpretation
Most men are ruled by the heart, not the head. Their plans are vague, and
when they meet obstacles they improvise. But improvisation will only
bring you as far as the next crisis, and is never a substitute for thinking
several steps ahead and planning to the end.

Balboa had a dream of glory and wealth, and a vague plan to reach it.
Yet his bold deeds, and his discovery of the Pacific, are largely forgotten,
for he committed what in the world of power is the ultimate sin: He went
part way, leaving the door open for others to take over. A real man of
power would have had the prudence to see the dangers in the distance——
the rivals who would want to share in the conquests, the vultures that
would hover once they heard the word “gold.” Balboa should have kept
his knowledge of the Incas secret until after he had conquered Peru. Only
then would his wealth, and his head, have been secure. Once Pedrarias ar-
rived on the scene, a man of power and prudence would have schemed to
kill or imprison him, and to take over the army he had brought for the
conquest of Peru. But Balboa was locked in the moment, always reacting
emotionally, never thinking ahead.

What good is it to have the greatest dream in the world if others reap
the benefits and the glory? Never lose your head over a vague, open-
ended drearn—plan to the end.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1863 the Prussian premier Otto von Bismarck surveyed the chessboard
of European power as it then stood. The main players were England,
France, and Austria. Prussia itself was one of several states in the loosely
allied German Federation. Austria, dominant member of the Federation,
made sure that the other German states remained weak, divided and sub»
missive. Bismarck believed that Prussia was destined for something far
greater than servant boy to Austria.

This is how Bismarck played the game. His first move was to start a
war with lowly Denmark, in order to recover the former Prussian lands of
Schleswig—Holstein, He knew that these rumblings of Prussian indepen-
dence might worry France and England, so he enlisted Austria in the war,
claiming that he was recovering Schleswig-Holstein for their benefit. ln a
few months, after the war was decided, Bismarck demanded that the
newly conquered lands be made part of Prussia. The Austrians of course
were furious, but they compromised: First they agreed to give the Prus-
aians Schleswig, and a year later they sold them Holstein. The world
began to see that Austria was weakening and that Prussia was on the rise.
Bismarck’s next move was his boldest: In 1866 he convinced King
William of Prussia to withdraw from the German Federation, and in doing
so to go to war with Austria itself. King William’s wife, his son the crown
prince, and the princes of the other German kingdoms vehemently op-
posed such a war. But Bismarck, undaunted, succeeded in forcing the con-
flict, and Prussia’s superior army defeated the Austrians in the brutally

short Seven Weeks War. The king and the Pmssian generals then wanted
to march on Vienna, tak.i.ug as much land from Austria as possible. But
Bismarck stopped them--now he presented himself as on the side of
peace. The result was that he was able to conclude a treaty with Austria
that granted Prussia and the other German states total autonomy. Bis-
marck could now position Prussia. as the dominant power in Germany and
the head of a newly formed North German Confederation.

The French and the English began to compare Bismarck to Attila the
Hun, and to fear that he had designs on all of Europe. Once he had started
on the path to conquest, there was no telling where he would stop. And,
indeed, three years later Bismarck provoked a war with France. First he
appeared to give his permission to France’s annexation of Belgium, then
at the last moment he changed his mind. Playing a caband-mouse game,
he infuriated the French emperor, Napoleon Ill, and stirred up his own
king against the French. To no one’s surprise, war broke out in 1870. The
newly formed German federation enthusiastically joined in the war
on France, and once again the Prussian military machine and its allies
destroyed the enemy army in a matter of months. Although Bismarck
opposed taking any French land, the generals convinced him that Alsace-
Lorraine would become part of the federation.

Now all of Europe feared the next move of the Prussian monster, led
by Bismarck, the “Iron Chancellor.” And in fact a year later Bismarck
founded the German Empire, with the Prussian king as the newly
crowned emperor and Bismarck himself a prince. But then something
strange happened: Bismarck instigated no more wars. And while the other
European powers grabbed up land for colonies in other continents, he se-
verely limited Germany’s colonial acquisitions. He did not want more
land for Germany, but more security. For the rest of his life he struggled to
maintain peace in Europe and to prevent further wars. Everybody as-
sumed he had changed, mellowing with the years. They had failed to un-
derstand: This was the final move of his original plan.

Interpretation
There is a simple reason why most men never know when to come off the
attack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once they achieve vic-
tory they only hunger for more. To stop-—to aim for a goal and then keep
to it——seems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is more critical to the
maintenance of power. The person who goes too far in his triumphs cre-
ates a reaction that inevitably leads to a decline. The only solution is to
plan for the long run. Foresee the future with as much clarity as the gods
on Mount Olympus, who look through the clouds and see the ends of all
things.

From the beginning of his career in polifics, Bismarck had one goal:
to form an independent German state led by Prussia. He instigated the
war with Denmark not to conquer territory but to stir up Prussian nation-
alism and unite the country. He incited the war with Austiia only to gain

Prussian independence. (This was why he refused to grab Austrian terri-
tory.) And he fomented the war with France to unite the German king-
doms against a common enemy, and thus to prepare for the formation of a
united Germany.

Once this was achieved, Bismarck stopped. He never let triumph go
to his head, was never tempted by the siren call of more. He held the rei.ns
tightly, and whenever the generals, or the king, or the Prussian people de-
manded new conquests, he held them back. Nothing would spoil
the
beauty of his creation, certainly not a false euphoria that pushed those
around him to attempt to go past the end that he had so carefully planned.

Experience shows that, if anef0Teset4.9_f1“amfaT away the designs to be
undertaken, one can act with speed when the moment comes to execute them.
Cardimzf ftichelieru, 1585-1642

KEYS TO POWER
According to the cosmology of the ancient Greeks, the gods were thought
to have complete vision into the future. They saw everything to come,
right down to the intricate details. Men, on the other hand, were seen as
victims of fate, trapped in the moment and their emotions, unable to see
beyond immediate dangers. Those heroes, such as Odysseus, who were
able to look beyond the present and plan several steps ahead, seemed to
defy fate, to approximate the gods in their ability to determine the future.
The comparison is still va.1id—those among us who think further ahead
and patiently bring their plans to fruition seem to have a godlike power.

Because most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan with
this kind of foresight, the ability to ignore immediate dangers and plea-
sures translates into power. It is the power of being able to overcome the
natural human tendency to react to things as they happen, and instead to
train oneself to step back, imagining the larger things taking shape beyond
one’s immediate vision. Most people believe that they are in fact aware of
the future, that they are planning and thinking ahead. They are usually de-
luded: What they are really doing is succumbing to their desires, to what
they want the future to be. Their plans are vague, based on their imagina-
tions rather than their reality. They may believe they are thinking all the
way to the end, but they are really only focusing on the happy ending, and
deluding themselves by the strength of their desire.

In 415 B.C., the ancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believing their ex-
pedition would bring them riches, power, and a glorious ending to the six-
teen-year Peloponnesian War. They did not consider the dangers of an
invasion so far from home; they did not foresee that the Sicilians would
light all the harder since the battles were in their own homeland, or that
all of Athens’s enemies would band together against them, or that war
would break out on several fronts, stretching their forces way too thin.
The Sicilian expedition was a complete disaster, leading to the destruction

.24!

of one of the greatest civilizations of all time. The Athenians were led into
this disaster by their hearts, not their minds. They saw only the chance of
glory, not the dangers that loomed in the distance.

Cardinal de Retz,

the seventeenth-century Frenchman who prided
himself on his insights into human schemes and why they mostly fail, ana-
lyzed this phenomenon. In the course of a rebellion he spearheaded
against the French monarchy in 1651, the young king, Louis XIV, and his
court had suddenly left Paris and established themselves in a palace out-
side the capital. The presence of the king so close to the heart of the revo-
lution had been a tremendous burden on the revolutionaries, and they
breathed a sigh of relief. This later proved their downfall, however, since
the court’s absence from Paris gave it much more room to maneuver.
“The most ordinary cause of people’s mistakes,” Cardinal de Retz later
wrote, “is their being too much frightened at the present danger, and not
enough so at that which is remote.”

The dangers that are remote, that loom in the distance-—if we can see
them as they take shape, how many mistakes we avoid. How many plans
we would instantly abort if we realized we were avoiding a small danger
only to step into a larger one. So much of power is not what you do but
what you do not do——the rash and foolish actions that you refrain from be-
fore they get you into trouble. Plan in detail before you act—do not let
this have unintended conse-
vague plans lead you into trouble. Will
quences? Will I stir up new enemies? Will someone else take advantage of
my labors? Unhappy endings are much more common than happy
ones——do not be swayed by the happy ending in your mind.

The French elections of 1848 came down to a struggle between Louis-
Adolphe Thiers, the man of order, and General Louis Eugene Cavaignac,
the rabble-rouser of the right When Thiers realized he was hopelessly be-
hind in this high—stakes race, he searched desperately for a solution. His
eye fell on Louis Bonaparte, grand-nephew of the great general Napoleon,
and a lowly deputy in the parliament. This Bonaparte seemed a bit of an
imbecile, but his name alone could get him elected in a country yearning
for a strong ruler. He would be Thiers’s puppet and eventually would be
pushed offstage. The first part of the plan worked to perfection, and
Napoleon was elected by a large margin. The problem was that Thiers
had not foreseen one simple fact: This “imbecile” was in fact a man of
enormous ambition. Three years later he dissolved parliament, declared
himself emperor, and ruled France for another eighteen years, much to
the horror of Thiers and his party.

The ending is everything. It is the end of the action that determines
who gets the glory, the money, the prize. Your conclusion must be crystal
clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind. You must also figure out
how to ward off the vultures circling overhead, trying to live off the car-
cass of your creation. And you must anticipate the many possible crises
that will tempt you to improvise. Bismarck overcame these dangers be-
cause he planned to the end, kept on course through every crisis, and

never let others steal the glory. Once he had reached his stated goal, he
withdrew into his shell like a turtle. This kind of selfcontrol is godlike.

When you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the way
to the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by the desire to
improvise. Your clarity will rid you of the anxiety and vagueness that are
the primary reasons why so many fail to conclude their actions success-
fully. You see the ending and you tolerate no deviation.

REVERSAL
It is a cliché among strategists that your plan must include alternatives and
have a degree of flexibility. That is certainly true. If you are locked into a
plan too rigidly, you will be unable to deal with sudden shifts of fortune.
Once you have examined the future possibilities and decided on your tar-
get, you must build in alternatives and be open to new routes toward your
goal.

Most people, however, lose less from overplanning and rigidity than
from vagueness and a tendency to improvise constantly in the face of Ci1‘~
cumstance. There is no real purpose in contemplating a reversal to this
Law, then, for no good can come from refusing to think far into the future
and planning to the end. If you are clear and fapthinking enough, you
will understand that the future is uncertain, and that you must be open to
adaptation. Only having 3. clear objective and a far-reaching plan allows
you that freedom.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
The Japanese tea ceremony called Cha~no—yu (“Hot Water for Tea”) has
origins in ancient times, but it reached its peak of refinement in the six~
teenth century under its most renowned practitioner, Sen no Rjlcyu. Al-
though not from a noble family, Rikyu rose to great power, becoming the
preferred tea master of the Emperor Hideyoshi, and an important adviser
on aesthetic and even political matters. For Rikyu, the secret of success
consisted in appearing natural, concealing the effort behind one’s work.

One day Rikyu and his son went to an acquaintance’s house for a tea
ceremony. On the way in, the son remarked that the lovely antique—look~
ing gate at their host’s house gave it an evocatively lonely appearance. “I
don’t think so,” replied his father, “it looks as though it had been brought
from some mountain temple along way off, and as if the labor required to
import it must have cost a lot of money.” If the owner of the house had put
this much effort into one gate, it would show in his tea ceremony-—-and in-
deed Sen no Rikyu had to leave the ceremony early, unable to endure the
affectation and effort it inadvertently revealed.

On another evening, while having tea at a friend’s house, Rikyu saw
his host go outside, hold up a lantem in the darkness, cut a lemon off a tree,
and bring it in. This charmed Rikyu--the host needed a. relish for the dish
he was serving, and had spontaneously gone outside to get one. But when
the man offered the lemon with some Osaka rice cake, Rikyu realized that
he had planned the cutting of the lemon all along, to go with this expensive
delicacy. The gesture no longer seemed spontane0us—~it was a way for the
host to prove his cleverness. He had accidentally revealed how hard he
was trying. Having seen enough, Rikyu politely declined the cake, excused
himself, and left.

Emperor Hideyoshi once planned to visit Rikyu for a. tea ceremony.
On the night before he was to come, snow began to fall. Thinking quickly,
Rikyu laid round cushions that fit exactly on each of the steppingvstones
that led through the garden to his house. Just before dawn, he rose, saw
that it had stopped snowing, and carefully removed the cushions. When
Hideyoshi arrived, he marveled at the simple beauty of the sight-—tl1e per-
fectly round stepping stones, unencumbered by snow——-and noticed how it
called no attention to the manner in which Rikyu had accomplished it, but
only to the polite gesture itself.

After Sen no Rikyu died, his ideas had a profound influence on the
practice of the tea ceremony. The Tokugawa shogun Yorinobu, son of the
great Emperor Ieyasu, was a student of Rikyu&#x27;s teachings. In his garden he
had a stone lantern made by a famous master, and Lord Sakai Tadakatsu
asked if he could come by one day to see it. Yoriuobu replied that he would
be honored, and commanded his gardeners to put everything in order for
the visit. These gardeners, unfamiliar with the precepts of Cha-no~yu,

fool who had mined the lantern, upsetting its natural grace and destroying
the whole purpose of Lord Sakafs visit.

When Yorinobu calmed down, however, he remembered that he had
originally bought two of the lanterns, and that the second was in his garden
on the island of Kishu. At great expense, he hired a whale boat and the
finest rowers he could find, ordering them to bring the lantern to him
within two days—a difficult feat at best, But the sailors rowed day and
night, and with the luck of a good wind they arrived just in time. To ‘[011-
nobu’s delight, this stone lantern was more magnificent than the first, for it
had stood untouched for twenty years in a bamboo thicket, acquiring 2-1
brilliant antique appearance and a delicate covering of moss. When Lord
Sakai arrived, later that same day, he was awed by the lantern, which was
more magnificent than he had imag1&#x27;ned———so graceful and at one with the
elements. Fortunately he had no idea what time and effort it had cost Yori-
nobu to create this sublime effect.

interpretation
To Sen no Rikyu, the sudden appearance of something naturally, almost
accidentally graceful was the height of beauty. This beauty came without
warning and seemed effortless. Nature created such things by its own laws
and processes, but men had to create their effects through labor and con-
trivance. And when they showed the effort of producing the effect, the e£
feet was spoiled. The gate came from too far away, the cutting of the lemon
looked contrived.

You will often have to use tricks and ingenuity to create your effects-—
the cushions in the snow, the men rowing all night——but your audience
must never suspect the work or the thinking that has gone into them. Na-
ture does not reveal its tricks, and what imitates nature by appearing effort-
less approximates nature’s power.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW H
The great escape artist Harry Houdini once advertised his act as “The lm~
possible Possible.&quot; And indeed those who witnessed his dramatic escapes
felt that what he did onstage contradicted commonsense ideas of human
capacity.

One evening in 1904, an audience of 4,000 Londoners filled a theater
to watch Houdini accept a challenge: to escape from a. pair of manacles
billed as the strongest ever invented. They contained six sets of locks and
nine tumblers in each cuff; a Birmingham maker had spent five years con-
structing them. Experts who examined them said they had never seen any-
thing so intricate, and this intricacy was thought to make them impossible
to escape.

The crowd watched the experts secure the manacles on Houdini’s
wrists. Then the escape artist entered a black cabinet on stage. The minutes

went by; the more time passed, the more certain it seemed that these man»
acles would be the first to defeat him. At one point he emerged from the
cabinet, and asked that the cuffs be temporarily removed so that he could
take off his coat—it was hot inside. The challengers refused, suspecting his
request was a trick to find out how the locks worked. Undeterred, and with
out using his hands, Houdini managed to lift the coat over his shoulders,
turn it inside out, remove a penknife from his vest pocket with his teeth,
and, by moving his head, out the coat off his arms. Freed from the coat, he
stepped back into the cabinet, the audience roaring with approval at his
grace and dexterity.

Finally, having kept

the audience wailing long enough, Houdini
emerged from the cabinet a second time, now with his hands free, the man-
acles raised high in triumph. To this day no one knows how he managed
the escape. Although he had taken close to an hour to free himself, he had
never looked concerned, had shown no sign of doubt. Indeed it seemed by
the end that he had drawn out the escape as a way to heighten the drama,
to make the audience worry-—-for there was no other sign that the perfon
mance had been anything but easy. The complaint about the heat was
equally part of the act. The spectators of this and other Houdini perfon
mances must have felt he was toying with them: These manacles are noth~
ing, he seemed to say, I could have freed myself a lot sooner, and from a
lot worse.

(3. half octopus, half whalelike beast

Over the years, Houdini escaped from the chained carcass of an em
that had
balmed “sea monster”
beached near Boston); he had himself sealed inside an enormous envelope
from which he emerged without breaking the paper; he passed through
brick walls; he wriggled free from straitjackets while dangling high in the
air; he leaped from bridges into icy waters, his hands manacled and his legs
in chains; he had himself submerged in glass cases full of water, hands pad-
locked, while the audience watched in amazement as he worked himself
free, struggling for close to an hour apparently without breathing. Each
time he seemed to court certain death yet survived with superhuman
aplomb. Meanwhile, he said nothing about his methods, gave no clues as
to how be accomplished any of his tricks——~he left his audiences and critics
speculating, his power and reputation enhanced by their struggles with the
inexplicable. Perhaps the most baffling trick of all was making a ten—thou-
sa.ud—pound elephant disappear before an audience’s eyes, a feat he re
peated on stage for over nineteen weeks. No one has ever really explained
how he did this, for in the auditorium where he performed the trick, there
was simply nowhere for an elephant to hide.

The effortlessness of Houdin1&quot;s escapes led some to think he used oc-
cult forces, his superior psychic abilities giving him special control over his
body. But a German escape artist named Kleppini claimed to know Hon»
dini’s secret: He simply used elaborate gadgets. Kleppini also claimed to
have defeated Houdini in a handcuff challenge in Holland.

Houdini did not mind all kinds of speculation floating around about

his methods, but he would not tolerate an outright lie, and in 1902 he chal-
lenged Kleppini to a handcuff duel. Kleppini accepted. Through a spy, he
found out the secret word to unlock a pair of French combination-lock
cuffs that Houdini liked to use. His plan was to choose these cuffs to escape
from onstage. This would definitively debunk Houdini—his “genius” sim-
ply lay in his use of mechanical gadgets.

On the night of the challenge, just as Kleppini had planned, Houdini
offered him a choice of cuffs and he selected the ones with the combination
lock. He was even able to disappear with them behind a screen to make a
quick test, and reemerged seconds later, confident of victory.

Acting as if he sensed fraud, Houdini refused to lock Kleppini in the
cuffs. The two men argued and began to fight, even wrestling with each
other onstage. After a few minutes of this, an apparently angry, frustrated
Houdini gave up and locked Kleppini in the cuffs. For the next few minutes
Kleppini strained to get free. Something was wrong——minutes earlier he
had opened the cuffs behind the screen; now the same code no longer
worked. He sweated, racking his brains. Hours went by, the audience left,
and finally an exhausted and humiliated Kleppini gave up and asked to be
released.

The cuffs that Kleppini himself had opened behind the screen with the
word “C—L—E-F—S” (French for “keys”) now clicked open only with the
word “F-R-A-U-D. ”Kleppini never figured out how Houdini had accom-
plished this uncanny feat.

Interpretation
Although we do not know for certain how Houdini accomplished many of
his most ingenious escapes, one thing is clear: It was not the occult, or any
kind of magic, that gave him his powers, but hard work and endless prac-
tice, all of which he carefully concealed from the world. Houdini never left
anything to chance-—-day and night he studied the workings of locks, re-
searched centuries-old sleight—of-hand tricks, pored over books on mechan
ics, whatever he could use. Every moment not spent researching he spent
working his body, keeping himself exceptionally limher, and learning how
to control his muscles and his breathing.

Early on in Houdini’s career, an old Japanese performer whom he
toured with taught him an ancient trick: how to swallow an ivory ball, then
bring it back up. He practiced this endlessly with a small peeled potato tied
to a string—up and down he would manipulate the potato with his throat
muscles, until they were strong enough to move it without the string. The
organizers of the London handcuff challenge had searched Houdini’s body
thoroughly beforehand, but no one could check the inside of his throat,
where he could have concealed small tools to help him escape. Even so,
Kleppini was fundamentally wrong: It was not Houdini’s tools but his prac-
tice, work, and research that made his escapes possible.

Kleppini, in fact, was completely outwitted by Houdini, who set the
whole thing up. He let his opponent learn the code to the French cuffs,

then baited him into choosing those cuffs onstage. Then, during the two
men’s tussle, the dexterous Houdini was able to change the code to “ER-
AvU-D.” He had spent weeks practicing this trick, but the audience saw
none of the sweat and toil behind the scenes. Nor was Houdini ever ner-
vous; he induced nervousness in others. (He deliberately dragged out the
time it would take to escape, as a way of heightening the drama, and mak-
ing the audience squirm.) His escapes from death, always graceful and
easy, made him look like a superman.

As a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly before
appearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose the sweat and
labor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will demonstrate their
diligence and honesty, but it actually just makes them look weaker-—as if
anyone who practiced and worked at it could do what they had done, or as
if they weren’t really up to the job. Keep your effort and your tricks to
yourself and you seem to have the grace and ease of a. god. One never sees
the source of a god’s power revealed; one only sees its effects.

KEYS TO POWER
Humanity‘s first notions of power came from primitive encounters with na-
ture-—the flash of lightning in the sky, a sudden flood, the speed and feroc
ity of a wild animal. These forces required no thinking, no planning—they
awed us by their sudden appearance, their gracefulness, and their power
over life and death. And this remains the kind of power we have always
wanted to imitate. Through science and technology we have recreated the
speed and sublime power of nature, but something is missing: Our ma~
chines are noisy and jerky, they reveal their effort. Even the very best cre-
ations of technology cannot root out our admiration for things that move
easily and effortlessly. The power of children to bend us to their will comes
from a kind of seductive charm that we feel in the presence‘ of a creature
less reflective and more graceful than we are. We cannot retum to such a
state, but if we can create the appearance of this kind of ease, we elicit in
others the kind of primitive awe that nature has always evoked in hu-
mankind.

One of the first European writers to expound on this principle came
from that most unnatural of environments, the Renaissance court. In 771:
Book ofthe Courtier, published in 1528, Baldassare Castiglione describes the
highly elaborate and codified manners of the perfect court citizen. And yet,
Castiglione explains, the courtier must execute these gestures with what he
calls .r[mzz,zatu1a, the capacity to make the difficult seem easy. He urges the
courtier to “practice in all things a certain nonchalance which conceals all

250 .

LAW 30

artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effort-
less.” We all admire the achievement of some unusual feat, but if it is ac-
complished naturally and gracefully, our admiration increases tenfold-—

“whereas .
shows an extreme lack of grace and causes everything, whatever its worth,
to be discounted.”

.

.

Much of the idea of sprezzalura came from the world of art. All the
great Renaissance artists carefully kept their works under wraps. Only the
finished masterpiece could be shown to the public. Michelangelo forbade
even popes to view his work in process. A Renaissance artist was always
careful to keep his studios shut to patrons and public alike, not out of fear
of imitation, but because to see the making of the works would mar the
magic of their effect, and their studied atmosphere of ease and natural
beauty.

The Renaissance painter Vasari, also the first great art critic, ridiculed
the work of Paolo Uccello, who was obsessed with the laws of perspective.
The elfort Uccello spent on improving the appearance of perspective was
too obvious in his work——it made his paintings ugly and labored, over-
whelmed by the elicit of their effects. We have the same response when we
watch performers who put too much effort into their act: Seeing them try-
ing so hard breaks the illusion. It also makes us uncomfortable. Calm,
graceful performers, on the other hand, set us at ease, creating the illusion
that they are not acting but being natural and themselves, even when
everything they are doing involves labor and practice.

The idea of sprewztum is relevant to all forms of power, for power
depends vitally on appearances and the illusions you create. Your public
actions are like artworks: They must have visual appeal, must create antici»
pation, even entertain. When you reveal the inner workings of your cre—
ation, you become just one more mortal among others. What
is
understandable is not awe-inspiring-—we tell ourselves we could do as well
if we had the money and time. Avoid the temptation of showing how
clever you are-—it is far more clever to conceal the mechanisms of your
cleverness.

Talleyrand’s application of this concept to his daily life greatly en»
hanced the aura of power that surrounded him. He never liked to work too
hard, so he made others do the work for hirn—-the spying, the research, the
detailed analyses. With all
this labor at his disposal, he himself never
seemed to strain. VVhen his spies revealed that a certain event was about to
take place, he would talk in social conversation as if he sensed its immi-
nence. The result was that people thought he was clairvoyant. His short
pithy statements and witticisms always seemed to summarize a situation
perfectly, but they were based on much research and thought. &#x27;13:: those in
government, including Napoleon himself, Talleyrand gave the impression
of immense power—an effect entirely dependent on the apparent ease
with which he accomplished his feats.

There is another reason for concealing your shortcuts and tricks:

LAW 30

251

When you let this information out, you give people ideas they can use
against you. You lose the advantages of keeping silent. We tend to want the
world to know what we have done--we want our vanity gratified by hay»
ing our hard work and cleverness applauded, and we may even want sym—
pathy for the hours it has taken to reach our point of artistry. Learn to
control this propensity to blab, for its effect is often the opposite of what
you expected. Remember: The more mystery surrounds your actions, the
more awesome your power seems, You appear to be the only one who can
do what you do--and the appearance of having an exclusive
is im-
mensely powerful. Finally, because you achieve your accomplishments
with grace and ease, people believe that you could always do more if you
tried harder. This elicits not only admiration but a touch of fear. Your pow-
ers are untapped-——no one can fathom their limits.

Image: The Racehorse. From up close we would see the

strain, the effort to control the horse, the labored, painful

breathing. But from the distance where we sit and watch, it

is all gracefulness, flying through the air. Keep others at a

distance and they will only see the ease with which you move.

Authority: For whatever action [nonchalance] accompanies, no
matter how trivial it is, it not only reveals the skill of the person
doing it but also very often causes it to be considered far greater
than it really is. This is because it makes the onlookers believe that
a man who performs well with so much faxsility must possess even
greater skill than he does. (Baldassare Castiglione, 14784529)

REVE RSAL
The secrecy with which you surround your azztions must seem lighthearted
in spirit. A zeal to conceal your work creates an unpleasant, almost para-
noiar: impression: you are taking the game too seriously. Houdini was care»
ful to make the concealment of his tricks seem a game, all part of the show.
Never show your work until it is finished, but if you put too much effort
into keeping it under wraps you will be like the painter Pontormo, who
spent the last years of his life hiding his frescoes from the public eye and
only succeeded in driving himself mad. Always keep your sense of humor
about yourself.

There are also times when revealing the inner workings of your pm
jects can prove worthwhile. It all depends on your andience’s taste, and on

252 — LAW 30

the times in which you operate. P. T. Barnum recognized that his public
wanted to feel involved in his shows, and that understanding his tricks de-
lighted them, partly, perhaps, because implicitly debunking people who
kept their sources of power hidden from the masses appealed to Ametica’s
democratic spirit. The public also appreciated the showman’s humor and
honesty. Barnum took this to the extreme of publicizing his own humbug—
gery in his popular autobiogzaphy, written when his career was at its
height.

As long as the partial disclosure of tricks and techniques is carefully
planned, rather than the result of an uncontrollable need to blab, it is the
ultimate in cleverness. It gives the audience the illusion of being superior
and involved, even while much of what you do remains concealed from
them.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
From early in his reign, Ivan IV, later known as Ivan the Terrible, had to
confront an unpleasant reality: The country desperately needed reform,
but he lacked the power to push it through. The greatest limit to his author-
ity Came from the boyars, the Russian princely class that dominated the
country and terrorized the peasantry.

In 1553, at the age of twenty-three, Ivan fell ill. Lying in bed, nearing
death, he asked the boyars to swear allegiance to his son as the new czar.
Some hesitated, some even refused. Then and there Ivan saw he had no
power over the boyars. He recovered from his illness, but he never forgot
the lesson: The boyars were out to destroy him. And indeed in the years to
come, many of the most powerful of them defected to Russia’s main ene-
mies, Poland and Lithuania, where they plotted their return and the over-
throw of the czar. Even one of Ivan’s closest
friends, Prince Andrey
Kurbski, suddenly turned against him, defecting to Lithuania in 1564, and
becoming the strongest of Iva.n’s enemies.

When Kurbski began raising troops for an invasion, the royal dynasty
seemed suddenly more precarious than ever. With émigré nobles foment-
ing invasion from the west, Tartars bearing down from the east, and the bcr
yars stirring up trouble within the country, Russia’s vast size made it a
nightmare to defend. In whatever direction Ivan struck, he would leave
himself vulnerable on the other side. Only if he had absolute power could
he deal with this many-headed Hydra. And he had no such power.

Ivan brooded until the morning of December 3, 1564, when the citi-
zens of Moscow awoke to a strange sight. Hundreds of sleds filled the
square before the Kremlin, loaded with the cza.r’s treasures and with provi-
sions for the entire court. They watched in disbelief as the czar and his
court boarded the sleds and left town. Without explaining why, he estab-
lished himself in a village south of Moscow. For an entire month a kind of
terror gripped the capital, for the Muscovites feared that Ivan had aban-
doned them to the bloodthirsty boyars. Shops closed up and riotous mobs
gathered daily. Finally, on January 3 of 1565, a. letter arrived from the czar,
explaining that he could no longer bear the boyars’ betrayals and had do
cided to abdicate once and for all.

Read aloud in public, the letter had a startling effect: Merchants and
commoners blamed the boyars for Ivan’s decision, and took to the streets,
terrifying the nobility with their fury. Soon a group of delegates represent-
ing the church, the princes, and the people made the journey to Ivan’s vil-
lage, and begged the czar, in the name of the holy land of Russia, to return
to the throne. Ivan listened but would not change his mind. After days of
hearing their pleas, however, he offered his subjects a choice: Either they
grant him absolute powers to govern as he pleased, with no interference
from the boyars, or they find a new leader.

Faced with a choice between civil war and the acceptance of despotic
power, almost every sector of Russian society “opted” for a strong czar,
calling for Ivan’s return to Moscow and the restoration of law and order. In

February, with much celebration, Ivan returned to Moscow. The Russians
could no longer complain if he behaved dictatorially-—-they had given him
this power themselves.

Interpretation
Ivan the Tenible faced a terrible dilemma: To give in to the boyars would
lead to certain destruction, but civil war would bring a different kind of
ruin. Even if Ivan came out of such a. war on top, the counhy would be dev-
astated and its divisions would be stronger than ever. His weapon of choice
in the past had been to make a bold, offensive move. Now, however, that
kind of move would turn against him—the more boldly be confronted his
enemies, the worse the reactions he would spark.

The main weakness of a show of force is that it stirs up resentment and
eventually leads to a response that eats at your authofity. Ivan, immensely
creative in the use of power, saw clearly that the only path to the kind of
victory he wanted was a false withdrawal. He would not force the country
over to his position, he would give it “options”: either his abdication, and
certain anarchy, or his accession to absolute power. To back up his move,
he made it clear that he preferred to abdicate: “Call my bluffi” he said,
“and watch what happens.” No one called his bluff. By withdrawing for just
a month, he showed the country a glimpse of the nightmares that would
follow his abdication-—Taxtar invasions, civil war, ruin. (All of these did
eventually come to pass after Ivan’s death, in the infamous “Time of the
Troubles”)

Withdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the op»
tions. You give people a sense of how things will fall apart without you, and
you offer them a “choice”: I stay away and you suffer the consequences, or
I retum under circumstances that I dictate. In this method of controlling
people’s options, they choose the option that gives you power because the
alternative is just too unpleasant. You force their hand, but indirectly: They
seem to have a choice. Whenever people feel they have a choice, they walk
into your trap that much more easily.

As a seventeenth-century French courtesan, Ninon de Lenclos found that
her life had certain pleasures. Her lovers came from royalty and aristoc-
racy, and they paid her well, entertained her with their wit and intellect,
satisfied her rather demanding sensual needs, and treated her almost as an
equal. Such a life was infinitely preferable to marriage. In 1643, however,
Ninon’s mother died suddenly, leaving her, at the age of twenty-three, to
tally alone in the world-«no family, no dowry, nothing to fallback upon. A
kind of panic overtook her and she entered a convent, tuming her back on
her illustrious lovers. A year later she left the convent and moved to Lyons.
When she finally reappeared in Paris, in 1648, lovers and suitors flocked to
her door in greater numbers than ever before, for she was the wittiest and

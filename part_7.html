KEYS TO POWER
Desire often creates paradoxical effects: The more you want something,
the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The more interest you
show, the more you repel the object of your desire. This is because your in«
terest is too su~ong—--it makes people awkward, even fearful. Uncontrol-
lable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic.

You need to turn your back on what you want. show your contempt
and disdain. This is the kind of powerful response that will drive your tar-
gets crazy. They will respond with a desire of their own, which is simply to
have an effect on you—perhaps to possess you, perhaps to hurt you. If they
want to possess you, you have successfully completed the first step of se-
duction. If they want to hurt you, you have unsettled them and made them
play by your rules (see Laws 8 and 39 on baiting people into action).

Contempt is the prerogative of the king. Where his eyes turn, what he
decides to see, is what has reality; what he ignores and turns his back on is
as good as dead. That was the weapon of King Louis XlV—-if he did not
like you, he acted as if you were not there, maintaining his superiority by
cutting off the dynamic of interaction. This is the power you have when
you play the card of contempt, periodically showing people that you can
do without them.

If choosing to ignore enhances your power, it follows that the opposite
approach-—commitment and engagement--ofien weakens you. By paying
undue attention to a puny enemy, you look puny, and the longer it takes
you to crush such an enemy, the larger the enemy seems. When Athens set
out to conquer the island of Sicily, in 415 B.C., 3, giant power was attacking a
tiny one. Yet by entangling Athens in a long—drawn—out conflict, Syracuse,
Sicily’s most important city-state, was able to grow in stature and confi»
it made itself famous for centuries to
dence. Finally defeating Athens,
come. In recent times, President john F. Kennedy made a similar mistake
in his attitude to Fidel Castro of Cuba: His failed invasion at the Bay of
Pigs, in 1961, made Castro an international hero.

A second danger: If you succeed in crushing the irritant, or even if you
merely wound it, you create sympathy for the weaker side. Critics of
Franklin D. Roosevelt complained bitterly about the money his adminis-
tration spent on government projects, but their attacks had no resonance
with the public, who saw the president as working to end the Great De~
pression. His opponents thought they had an example that would show just
how wasteful he had become: his dog, Fala, which he lavished with favors
and attention. Critics railed at his insensifivitywspendmg taxpayers‘
money on a dog while so many Americans were still in poverty. But Roo-
sevelt had a response: How dare his critics attack a defenseless little dog?

His speech in defense of Fala was one of the most popular he ever gave. In
this case, the weak party involved was the president’s dog and the attack
backfired-in the long run, it only made the president more sympathetic,
since many people will naturally side with the “underdog,” just as the
American public came to sympathize with the wily but outnumbered Pan-
cho Villa.

It is tempting to want to fix our mistakes, but the harder we try, the
worse we often make them. It is sometimes more politic to leave them
alone. In 1971, when the New Ybrk limes published the Pentagon Papers, a
group of government documents about the history of US. involvement in
Indochina, Henry Kissinger erupted into a volcanic rage. Furious about the
Nixon administi-ation’s vulnerability to this kind of damaging leak, he
made recommendations that eventually led to the formation of a group
called the Plumbers to plug the leaks. This was the unit that later broke into
Democratic Party offices in the Watergate Hotel, setting off the chain of
events that led to Nixon’s downfall. In reality the publication of the Penta-
gon Papers was not a serious threat to the administration, but Kissingefs
reaction made it a big deal. In trying to fix one problem, he created an-
other: a paranoia for security that in the end was much more destructive to
the government. Had he ignored the Pentagon Papers, the scandal they
had created would eventually have blown over.

Instead of inadvertently focusing attention on a problem, making it
seem worse by publicizing how much concern and anxiety it is causing
you, it is ofien far wiser to play the contemptuous aristocrat, not deigning
to acknowledge the problem’s existence. There are several ways to execute
this strategy.

First there is the sour-grapes approach. If there is something you want
but that you realize you cannot have, the worst thing you can do is draw at-
tention to your disappointment by complaining about it. An infinitely
more powerful tactic is to act as if it never really interested you in the first
place. When the writer George Sand’s supporters nominated her to be the
first female member of the Académie Frangaise, in 1861, Sand quickly saw
that the academy would never admit her. Instead of whining, though, she
claimed she had no interest in belonging to this group of worn—out, over-
rated, outAof—touch windbags. Her disdain was the perfect response: Had
she shown her anger at her exclusion, she would have revealed how much
it meant to her. Instead she branded the academy a club of old mem-and
why should she be angry or disappointed at not having to spend her time
with them? Crying “sour grapes” is sometimes seen as a reflection of the
weak; it is actually the tactic of the powerful.

Second, when you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people’s atten-
tion by making it clear that the attack has not even registered. Look away,
or answer sweetly, showing how little the attack concerns you. Similarly,
when you yourself have committed a blunder, the best response is often to
make less of your mistake by treating it lightly

owned a priceless antique tea howl that all the coui-tiers envied. One day a
guest, Dainagon Tsunehiro. asked if he could carry the tea bowl into the
light, to examine it more closely. The bowl rarely left the table, but the em-
peror was in good spirits and he consented. As Dainagori carried the bowl
to the railing of the verandah, however, and held it up to the light, it
slipped from his hands and fell on a rock in the garden below, smashing
into tiny fragments.

The emperor of course was furious. “It was indeed most clumsy of me
to let it drop in this way,” said Dainagon, with a deep how, “but really
there is not much harm done. This ldo tea~bowl is a very old one and it is
impossible to say how much longer it would have lasted, but anyhow it is
not a thing of any public use, so I think it rather fortunate that it has broken
thus.” This surprising response had an immediate effect: The emperor
calmed down. Dainagon neither sniveled nor overapologized, but signaled
his own worth and power by treating his mistake with a touch of disdain.
The emperor had to respond with a similar aristocratic indifference; his
anger had made him seem low and petty——an image Dainagon was able to
manipulate.

Among equals this tactic might bacldire: Your indifference could make
you seem callous. But with a master, if you act quickly and without great
fuss, it can work to great effect: You bypass his angry response, save him
the time and energy he would waste by brooding over it, and allow him the
opportunity to display his own lack of pettiness publicly.

If we make excuses and denials when we are caught in a mistake or a
deception, we stir the waters and make the situation worse. It is ofien wiser
to play things the opposite way. The Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino
often boasted of his aristocratic lineage, which was, of course, a fiction,
since he was actually the son of a shoemaker. When an enemy of his finally
revealed the embarrassing truth, word quiddy spread, and soon all of
Venice (where he lived at the time) was aghast at Aretino’s lies. Had he
tried to defend himself, he would have only dragged himself down. His re-
sponse was masterful: He announced that he was indeed the son of a shoe-
maker, but this only proved his greatness, since he had risen from the
lowest stratum of society to its very pinnacle. From then on he never men-
tioned his previous lie, trumpeting instead his new position on the matter
of his ancestry.

Remember: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances and
irritations are contempt and disdain. Never show that something has af-
fected you, or that you are offended——that only shows you have acknowl-
edged a problem. Contempt is a dish that is best served cold and without
affectarion.

Authority: Know how to play the card of contempt. It is the most politic
kind of revenge. For there are many of whom we should have known
nothing if their distinguished opponents had taken no notice of them.
There is no revenge like oblivion, for it is the entombment of the unwor-
thy in the dust of their own nothingness. (Baltasar Gracién, 1601-1658)

REVERSAL
You must play the card of contempt with care and delicacy. Most small
troubles will vanish on their own if you leave them be; but some will grow
and fester unless you attend to them. Ignore a person of inferior stature and
the next time you look he has become a serious rival, and your contempt
has made him vengeful as well. The geat princes of Renaissance Italy
chose to ignore Cesare Borgia at the outset of his career as a young general
in the army of his father, Pope Alexander VI. By the time they paid a1ten~
tion it was too lat.e——the cub was now a lion, gobbling up chunks of Italy.
Often, then, while you show contempt publicly you will also need to keep
an eye on the problem privately, monitoring its status and making sure it
goes away. Do not let it become a cancerous cell.

Develop the skill of sensing problems when they are still small and
taking care of them before they become intractable. Leam to distinguish
between the potentially disastrous and the mildly irritating, the nuisance
that will quietly go away on its own. In either case, though, never com—
pletely take your eye oil&quot; it. As long as it is alive it can smolder and spark
into life.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
In the early 1780s. word spread through Berlin of the strange and spectacu-
lar medical practice of a Dr. Weisleder. He performed his miracles in an
enormous converted beer hall, outside which Berliners began to notice
ever longer lines of people—-the blind, the lame, anyone with an illness in
curable by normal medicine. When it leaked out that the doctor worked by
exposing the patient to the rays of the moon, he soon became dubbed The
Moon Doctor of Berlin.

Sometime in 1783, it was reported that Dr. Weisleder had cured a well»
to—do woman of a terrible ailment. He suddenly became a celebrity. Previ~
ously only the poorest Berliners had been seen waiting outside the beer
hall in their rags; now magnificent carriages were parked outside, and gen-
tlemen in frock coats, and ladies with enormous coiffures, lined the street
as sunset drew near. Even folk with the mildest of ailments came, out of
sheer curiosity, As they waited in line, the poorer clients would explain to
the gentlemen and ladies that the doctor only practiced when the moon
was in its increscent phase. Many would add that they themselves had al
ready been exposed to the healing powers he called forth from the rays of
the moon. Even those who felt cured kept coming back, drawn by this
powerful experience.

Inside the beer hall, a strange and stirring spectacle greeted the visitor:
Packed into the entrance hall was a crowd of all classes and ethnic bar.k~
grounds, a veritable Tower of Babel. Through tall windows on the northern
side of the hall, silvery moonlight poured in at odd angles. The doctor and
his wife, who, it seemed, was also able to effect the cure, practiced on the
second floor, which was reached by at stairway, at the end of the hall. As the
line edged closer to the stairs, the sick would hear shouts and cries from
above, and word would spread of, perhaps, a blind gentleman suddenly
able to see.

Once upstairs, the line would fork in two directions, toward a north-
ern room for the doctor, a southern one for his wife, who worked only on
the ladies. Finally, after hours of anticipation and waiting in line, the gen-
tlemen patients would be led before the amazing doctor himself, an cl‘
derly man with a few stalks of wild gray hair and an air of nervous energy.
He would take the patient (let us say a young boy, brought in by his fa-
ther), uncover the afflicted body part, and lift the boy up to the window,
which faced the light of the moon. He would rub the site of the injury or
illness, mumble something unintelligible, look knowingly at the moon,
and then, after collecting his fee, send the boy and his father on their way.
Meanwhile, in the sout.h~faciug room, his wife would be doing the same
with the 1adies~——which was odd, really, since the moon cannot appear in
two places at once; it cannot have been visible, in other words, from both
windows. Apparently the mere thought, idea, and symbol of the moon
were enough, for the ladies did not complain, and would later remark
confidently that the wife of the Moon Doctor had the same healing powers
as he.

Interpretation
Dr Weislecler may have known nothing about medicine, but he under-
stood human nature. He recognized that people do not always want words,
or rational explanations, or demonstrations of the powers of science; they
want an immediate appeal to their emotions. Give them that and they will
do the rest—such as imagine they can be healed by the light reflected from
a rock a quarter million miles away. Dr. Weisleder had no need of pills, or
of lengthy lectures on the moon’s power, or of any silly gadgetry to amplify
its rays. He understood that the simpler the spectacle the better—just the
moonlight pouring in from the side, the stairway leading to the heavens,
and the rays of the moon, whether directly visible or not. Any added ef-
fects might have made it seem that the moon was not strong enough on its
own. And the moon was strong enough——it was a magnet for fantasies, as it
has been throughout history. Simply by associating himself with the image
of the moon, the doctor gained power.

Remember: Your search for power depends on shortcuts. You must al-
ways circumvent people’s suspicions, their perverse desire to resist your
will. Images are an extremely effective shortcut: Bypassing the head, the
seat of doubt and resistance, they aim straight for the heart. Overwhelming
the eyes, they create powerful associations, bringing people together and
stirring their emotions. With the white light of the moon in their eyes, your
targets are blinded to the deceptions you practice.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In 1536 the future king Henri II of France took his first mistress, Diane de
Poitiers. Diane was t.hirty—seven at the time, and was the widow of the
grand seneschal of Normandy. Henri, meanwhile, was a sprightly lad of
seventeen, who was just beginning to sow his wild oats. At first their union
seemed merely platonic, with Henri showing an intensely spiritual devo-
tion to Diane. But it soon became clear that he loved her in every way, pre-
ferring her bed to that of his young wife, Catherine de’ Médicis.

In 1547 King Francis died and Henri ascended to the throne. This new
situation posed perils for Diane de Poitiers. She had just turned forty-eight,
and despite her notorious cold baths and rumored youth potions, she was
beginning to show her age; now that Henri was king, perhaps he would re-
turn to the queen&#x27;s bed, and do as other kings had done—choose mis-
tresses from the bevy of beauties who made the French court the envy of
Europe. He was, after all, only twenty-eight, and cut a dashing figure. But
Diane did not give up so easily. She would continue to enthrall her lover,
as she had enthralled him for the past eleven years.

Diane’s secret weapons were symbols and images, to which she had al-
ways paid great attention. Early on in her relationship with Henri, she had
created a motif by intertwining her initials with his, to symbolize their
union. The idea worked like a charm: Henri put this insignia everywhere-
on his royal robes, on monuments, on churches, on the facade of the

Louvre, then the royal palace in Paris. Dia.ne’s favorite colors were black
and white, which she wore exclusively, and wherever it was possible the in-
signia appeared in these colors. Everyone recognized the symbol and its
meaning. Soon after Henri took the throne, however, Diane went still fur»
ther: She decided to identify herself with the Roman goddess Diana, her
namesake. Diana was the goddess of the hunt, the traditional royal pastime
and the particular passion of Henri. Equally important, in Renaissance an
she symbolized chastity and purity. For a woman like Diane to identify her-
self with this goddess would instantly call up those images in the court, giv-
ing her an air of respectability. Symbolizing her “chaste” relationship with
Henri, it would also set her apart from the adulterous liaisons of royal mis-
tresses past.

To efiect this association, Diane began by completely transforming her
castle at Anet. She razed the building’s structure and in its place erected a
magnificent Doric-columned edifice modeled after a Roman temple. It was ~
made in white Normandy stone flecked with black silex, reproducing
Diane’s trademark colors of black and white. The insignia of her and
Henn&quot;s initials appeared on the columns, the doors, the windows, the can
pet. Meanwhile, symbols of Diana—crescent moons, stags, and hounds-
adomed the gates and facade.
Inside, enormous tapestries depicting
episodes in the life of the goddess lay on the floors and hung on the walls.
In the garden stood the famous Goujon sculpture Diane Chasseresxe, which is
now in the Louvre, and which had an uncanny resemblance to Diane de
Poitiers. Paintings and other depictions of Diana appeared in every comer
of the castle.

Anet overwhelmed Henri, who soon was trumpeting the image of
Diane de Poitiers as a Roman goddess. In 1548, when the couple appeared
together in Lyons for a royal celebration, the townspeople welcomed them
with a tableau vimznt depicting a scene with Diana the huntress. France’s
greatest poet of the period, Pierre de Ronsard, began to write verses in
honor of Diana—indeed a kind of cult of Diana sprang up, all inspired by
the king’s mistress. It seemed to Henri that Diane had given herself a kind
of divine aura, and as if he were destined to worship her for the rest of his
life. And until his death, in 1559, he did remain faithful to her—making her
a duchess, giving her untold wealth, and displaying an almost religious do
votion to his first and only mistress.

Interpretation
Diane de Poitiers, a woman from a modest bourgeois background, man-
aged to captivate Henri for over twenty years. By the time he died she was
well into her sixties, yet his passion for her only increased with the years.
She knew the king well. He was not an intellectual but a lover of the out-
doors——he particularly loved jousting tournaments, with their bright pen-
nants, brilliantly caparisoned horses, and beautifully dressed women.
Henri’s love of visual splendor seemed childlike to Diane, and she played
on this weakness of his at every opportunity.

Most astute of all was Diane’s appropriation of the goddess Diana.
Here she took the game beyond physical imagery into the realm of the psy-
chic symbol. It was quite a feat to transform a king’s mistress into an em-
blem of power and purity, but she managed it. Vfithout the resonance of
the goddess, Diane was merely anraging courtesan. With the imagery and
symbolism of Diana on her shoulders, she seemed a mythic force, destined
for greatness.

You too can play with images like these, weaving visual clues into an
encompassing gestalt, as Diane did with her colors and her insignia. Estab-
lish a trademark like these to set yourself apart. Then take the game fur
ther: Find an image or symbol from l&#x27;.l1e past that will neatly fit your
situation, and put it on your shoulders like a cape. It will make you seem
larger than life.

and often end up believing the opposite of what they say. (That is part of
our perverse nature.) It also happens that words offend us, stirring up asso-
ciations unintended by the speaker.

The visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of words. It
strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for re-
flecfion and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational, reasonable
droughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case for his medical
practice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling them about the
healing powers of the moon, and about his own special connection to a dis-
tant object in the sky. Fortunately for him, he was able to create a com-
pelling spectacle that made words unnecessary. The moment his patients
entered the beer hall, the image of the moon spoke eloquently enough.

Understand: Words put you on the defensive. If you have to explain
yourself your power is already in question. The image, on the other hand,
imposes itself as a given. It discourages questions, creates forceful associa-
resists unintended interpretations, communicates instantly, and
tions,
forges bonds that transcend social dilferences. Words stir up arguments
and divisions; images bring people together. They are the quintessential in-
struments of power.

Diana) or a verbal description of something visual (the words “the Sun
King”). The symbolic object stands for something else, something abstract
(such as the image “Diana” standing for chastity). The abstract concept-
purity, patriotism, courage, lovc~—~is full of emotional and powerful associa-
tions. The symbol
is a shortcut of expression, containing dozens of
meanings in one simple phrase or object. The symbol of the Sun King, as
explained by Louis XIV, can be read on many layers, but the beauty of it is
that its associations required no explanation, spoke immediately to his sub-
jects, distinguished him from all other kings, and conjured up a kind of
majesty that went far beyond the words themselves. The symbol contains
untold power.

The first step in using symbols and images is to understand the pri-
macy of sight among the senses. Before the Renaissance, it has been an
gued, sight and the other senses--taste, touch, and so on-—-operated on a
relatively equal plane. Since then, however, the visual has come to domi-
nate the others, and is the sense we most depend on and trust. As Gracién
said, “The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.” When the Renaissance
painter Fra Filippo Lippi was a captured slave among the Moors, he won
his freedom by sketching a drawing of his master on a white wall with a
piece of charcoal; when the owner saw the drawing, he instantly under-
stood the power of a man who could make such images, and let Fra Lippi
go. That one image was far more powerful than any argument the artist
could have made with words.

Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color,
for example, have enormous symbolic resonance. When the con artist Yel-
low Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he was ped-
dling, he called it the “Red Letter Newsletter” and had it printed, at
considerable expense, in red ink. The color created a sense of urgency,
power, and good fortune. Weil recognized details like these as keys to de-
ception—as do modern advertisers and mass-marketers. If you use “gold”
in the title of anything you are trying to sell, for example, print it in gold.
. Since the eye predominates, people will respond more to the color than to

the word.

The wsual contains great emotional power. The Roman emperor Con-
stantine worshipped the sun as a god for most of his life; one day, though,
he looked up at the sun, and saw a cross superimposed on it. The vision of
the cross over the sun proved to him the ascendancy of the new religion,
and he converted not just himself but the whole Roman Empire to Chris-
tianity soon thereafter. All the preaching and proselytizing in the world
could not have been as powerful. Find and associate yourself with the im-
ages and symbols that will communicate in this immediate way today, and
you will have untold power.

Most effective of all is anew con1bination—a fusion of images and sym-
bols that have not been seen together before, but that through their associ-
ation clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The creation of
new images and symbols out of old ones in this way has a poetic effect-
viewers’ associations run rampant. giving them a sense of participation.

Near the end of World War II, orders came down from General Eisen-
hower thax American troops were to lead the way into Paris after its liber~
ation from the Nazis. The French general Charles de Gaulle, however,
realized that this sequence would imply that the Americans now com-
manded the fate of France. Through much manipulation, de Gaulle made
certain that he and the French Second Armored Division would appear at
the head of the liberating force. The strategy worked: After he had success
fully pulled off this stunt, the Allies started treating him as the new leader
of an independent France. De Gaulle knew that a leader has to locate him’
self literally at the head of his troops. This visual association is crucial to the
emotional response that he needs to elicit.

Things change in the game of symbols: It is probably no longer possiv
ble to pose as a “sun king,” or to wrap the mantle of Diana around you. Yet
you can associate yourself with such symbols more indirectly. And, of
course, you can make your own mythology out of figures from more re-
cent history, people who are comfortably dead but still powerfully associaw
five in the public eye. The idea is to give yourself an aura, a stature that
your normal banal appearance simply will not create. By herself Diane de
Poitiers had no such radiant powers; she was as human and ordinary as
most of us. But the symbol elevated her above the human lot, and made
her seem divine.

Using symbols also has a courtierlike effect, since they are often gen-
tler than brutish words. The psychotherapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson al-
ways tried to find symbols and images that would communicate to the
patient in ways that words could not. When dealing with a severely trou~
bled patient, he would not question him directly but would talk about
something irrelevant, such as driving through the desert in Arizona, where
he practiced in the 19505. In describing this he would eventually come to
an appropriate symbol for what he suspected was the man’s problem. If he
felt the palient was isolated, say, Dr. Erickson would talk of a single iron-
wood tree, and how its isolation left it battered by the winds. Making an
emotional connection with the tree as a symbol, the patient would open up
more readily to the doctor’: probing.

Use the power of symbols as a way to rally, animate, and unite your
troops or team. During the rebellion against the French crown in 1648,
those loyal to the king disparaged the rebels by comparing them to the
slingshots (in French, fiandesl that little boys use to frighten big boys. Cardi~
nal de Retz decided to turn this disparaging term into the rebels’ symbol:
The uprising was now known as the Fronde, and the rebels as fivndeurs.
They began to wear sashes in their hats that symbolized the slingshot, and
the word became their rallying cry. Without it the rebellion might well
have petered out Always find a symbol to represent your cause—the more
emotional associations, the better.

The best way to use images and symbols is to organize them into a

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Around the year 478 B.C., the city of Sparta sent an expedition to Persia led
by the young Spartan nobleman Pausanias. The city—states of Greece had
recently fought off a mighty invasion from Persia, and now Pausanias,
along with allied ships from Athens, had orders to punish the invaders and
win back the islands and coastal towns that the Persians had occupied.
Both the Athenians and the Spartans had great respect for Pausanias-—he
had proven himself as a fearless warrior, with a flair for the dramatic.
With amazing speed, Pausanias and his troops took Cyprus,
then
moved on to the mainland of Asia Minor known as the Hellespont and
captured Byzantium {modem-day Istanbul). Now master of part of the Per-
sian empire, Pausanias began to show signs of behavior that went beyond
his normal flarnboyance. He appeared in public wearing pomades in his
hair and flowing Persian robes, and accompanied by a bodyguard of Egyp-
tians. He held lavish banquets in which he sat in the Persian manner and
demanded to be entertained. He stopped seeing his old friends, entered
into communication with the Persian King Xerxes, and all in all affected
the style and manner of a Persian dictator.

Clearly power and success had gone to Pausanias’s head. His army-
Athenians and Spartans alike—at first thought this a passing fancy: He had
always been a bit exaggerated in his gestures. But when he ilaunted his dis-
dain for the Greeks’ simple way of life, and insulted the common Greek
soldier, they began to feel he had gone too far. Although there was no con’
crete evidence for this, rumors spread that he had gone over to the other
side, and that he dreamed of becoming a kind of Greek Xerxes. To quell
the possibility of mutiny, the Spartans relieved Pausanias of his command
and called him home.

Pausanias, however, continued to dress in the Persian style, even in
Sparta. After a few months be independently hired a trireme and returned
to the Hellespont, telling his compatriots he was going to continue the Fight
against the Persians. Actually, however, he had different plans———to make
himself ruler of all Greece, with the aid of Xerxes himself. The Spartans
declared him a public enemy and sent a ship to Capture him. Pausanias sur-
rendered, certainlthat he could clear himself of the charges of treason. It
did come out during the trial that during his reign as commander he had
offended his fellow Greeks time and again, erecting monuments, for in-
stance, in his own name, rather than in those of the cities whose troops had
fought alongside him, as was the custom. Yet Pausanias proved right: De~
spite the evidence of his numerous contacts with the enemy, the Spartans
refused to imprison a man of such noble birth, and let him go.

Now thinking himself untouchable, Pausanias hired a messenger to
take a letter to Xerxes, but the messenger instead took the letter to the
Spartan authorities. These men wanted to find out more, so they had the
messenger arrange to meet Pausanias in a temple where they could hide
and listen behind a partition. l/Vhat Pausanias said shocked them»-they
had never heard such contempt for their ways spoken so brazenly by one
of their 0wn—-—and they made arrangements for his immediate arrest.

On his way home from the temple, Pausanias got word of what had
happened. He ran to another temple to hide, but the authorities followed
him there and placed sentries all around. Pausanias refused to surrender.
Unwilling to forcibly remove him from the sacred temple, the authorities
kept him trapped inside, until he eventually died of starvation.

Interpretation
At first glance it might seem that Pausanias simply fell in love with another
culture, a phenomenon as old as time. Never comfortable with the asceti-
cism of the Spartans, he found himself enthralled by the Persian love of
luxury and sensual pleasure. He put on Persian robes and perfumes with a
sense of deliverance from Greek discipline and simplicity.

This is how it appears when people adopt a culture in which they were
not raised. Often, however, there is also something else at play: People
who flaunt their infatuation with a different culture are expressing a dis
dain and contempt for their own. They are using the outward appearance
of the exotic to separate themselves from the common folk who unques-
tioningly follow the local customs and laws, and to express their sense of
superiority. Otherwise they would act with more dignity, showing respect
for those who do not share their desires. Indeed their need to show their
difference so dramatically often makes them disliked by the people whose
beliefs they challenge,
indirectly and subtly, perhaps, but’ offensively
nonetheless.

As Thucydides wrote of Pausanias, “By his contempt for the laws and
his imitation of foreign ways he had made himself very widely suspected of
being unwilling to abide by normal standards.” Cultures have norms that
reflect centuries of shared beliefs and ideals. Do not expect to scoff at such
things with impunity. You will be punished somehow, even if just through
isolation—a position of real powerlessness.

Many of us, like Pausanias, feel the siren call of the exotic, the foreign‘
Measure and moderate this desire. Flaunting your pleasure in alien ways of
thinking and acting will reveal a different motive————to demonstrate your su-
periority over your fellows.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAVV
During the late sixteenth century, a violent reaction against the Protestant
Reformation erupted in Italy. The Counter-Reformation, as it was called,
included its own version of the Inquisition to root out all deviations from
the Catholic Church. Among its victims was the scientist Galileo, but an
important thinker who suffered even greater persecution was the Domini-
can monk and philosopher Tommaso Campanella.

A follower of the materialist doctrine of the Roman philosopher Epi-
cums, Campanella did not believe in miracles, or in heaven and hell. The
Church had promoted such superstitions, he wrote, to control the common
folk by keeping them in fear. Such ideas verged on atheism, and Cam-
panella. expressed them incautiously. In 1593 the Inquisition threw him

into prison for his heretical beliefs. Six years later, as a form of partial re
lease, he was confined to a monastery in Naples.

Southern Italy was controlled by Spain at the time, and in Naples
Campanella became involved in a plot to fight and throw out these in»
vaders. His hope was to establish an independent republic based on his
own ideas of utopia. The leaders of the Italian Inquisition, working with
their Spanish counterparts, had him imprisoned again. This time they also
tortured him, to discover the true nature of his impious beliefs: He was sub-
jected to the infamous la zzeglia, a torture in which he was suspended by his
arms in a squatting position a few inches above a seat studded with spikes.
The posture was impossible to sustain, and in time the victim would end up
sitting on the spikes, which would tear his flesh at the slightest contact.

During these years, however, Campanella learned something about
power. Facing the prospect of execution for heresy, he changed his s|:a.t~
egy: He would not renounce his beliefs, yet he knew he had to disguise
their outward appearance.

To save his life, Campanella feigned madness. He let his inquisifors
imagine thax his beliefs stemmed from an inconuollable unsoundness of
mind. For a while the tortures continued, to see if his insanity was faked,
but in 1603 his sentence was commuted to life in prison. The first four
years of this he spent chained to a wall in an underground dungeon. De»
spite such conditions, he continued to write--although no longer would he
be so foolish as to express his ideas directly.

One book of Ca.mpa.uella’s, 771:: Hispanic Monardzy, promoted the idea
that Spain had a divine. mission to expand its powers around the world,
and offered the Spanish king practical, Machiavelli-type advice for achiev-
ing this. Despite his own interest in Machiavelli, the book in general pre
sented ideas completely the opposite to his own. The Hispanirr Monarchy was
in fact a ploy, an attempt to show his conversion to orthodoxy in the bold-
est manner possible. It worked: In 1626, six years after its publication, the
pope finally let Campanella out of prison.

Shortly afier gaining his freedom, Campanella wrote Atheism Con»
guered, a book attacking ‘free-thinkers, Machiavellians, Calvinists, and
heretics of all stripes. The book is written in the form of debates in which
heretics express their beliefs and are countered by arguments for the supe
riority of Catholicism. Campanella had obviously reformed-his book
made that clear. Or did it?

The arguments in the mouths of the heretics had never before been
expressed with such verve and freshness. Pretending to present their side
only to knock it down, Campanella actually summarized the case against
Caxholicism with striking passion. “Then he argued the other side, suppos-
edly his side, on the other hand, he resorted to stale clichés and convoluted
rationales. Brief and eloquent, the heretics’ arguments seemed bold and
sincere. The lengthy arguments for Catholicism seemed tiresome and 1m»
convincing.

Catholics who read the book found it disturbing and ambiguous, but

they could not claim it was heretical, or that Campanella should be re-
turned to prison. His defense of Catholicism, after all, used arguments they
had used themselves. Yet in the years to come, Atizeism Conquered became a
bible for atheists, Machiavellians and liberfines who used the arguments
Campanella had put in their mouths to defend their dangerous ideas. Com-
bining an outward display of conformity with an expression of his true he»
liefs in a way that his sympathizers would understand, Campanella showed
that he had learned his lesson.

Interpretation

In the face of awesome persecution, Campanella devised three strate-
gic moves that saved his hide, freed him from prison, and allowed him to
continue to express his beliefs. First he feigned ma.dness—«the medieval
equivalent of disavowing responsibility for one’s actions,
like blaming
one’s parents today. Next he wrote a book that expressed the exact oppo-
site of his own beliefs. Finally, and most brilliantly of all, he disguised his
ideas while insinuating them at the same time. It is an old but powerful
trick: You pretend to disagree with dangerous ideas, but in the course of
your disagreement you give those ideas expression and exposure. You
seem to conform to the prevailing orthodoxy, but those who know will un-
derstand the irony involved. You are protected.

It is inevitable in society that certain values and customs lose contact
with their original motives and become oppressive. And there will always
be those who rebel against such oppression. harboring ideas far ahead of
their time. As Campanella was forced to realize, however, there is no point
in making a display of your dangerous ideas if they only bring you sullen
ing and persecution. Martyrdom serves no purpose~——better to live on in an
oppressive world, even to thrive in it Meanwhile find a way to express
your ideas subtly for those who understand you. Laying your pearls before
swine will only bring you trouble.

what we want to, then, but on the outside we wear a mask.

ority of their values and beliefs. In the end, though, their arguments con-
vince only a few and offend a great deal more. The reason arguments do
not work is that most people hold their ideas and values without thinking
about them. There is a strong emotional content in their beliefs: They re-
ally do not want to have to rework their habits of thinking, and when you
challenge them, whether directly through your arguments or indirectly
through your behavior, they are hostile.

Wise and clever people learn early on that they can display conven-
tional behavior and mouth conventional ideas without having to believe in
them. The power these people gain from blending in is that of being left
alone to have the thoughts they want to have, and to express them to the
people they want to express them to, without suliering isolation or as
tracism. Once they have established themselves in a position of power,
they can try to convince a wider circle of the correctness of their ideas-
perhaps working indirectly, using Campanella’s strategies of irony and in-
sinuation.

In the late fourteenth century, the Spanish began a. massive persecu-
tion of the Jews, murdering thousands and driving others out of the coun»
try. Those who remained in Spain were forced to convert. Yet over the next
three hundred years, the Spanish noticed a phenomenon that disturbed
them: Many of the converts lived their outward lives as Catholics, yet
somehow managed to retain their Jewish beliefs, practicing the religion in
private. Many of these so-called Marranos (originally a derogatory term,
being the Spanish for “pig”) attained high levels of government office, mar-
ried into the nobility, and gave every appearance of Christian piety, only
to be discovered late in life as practicing Jews. (The Spanish Inquisition
was specifically commissioned to ferret them out.) Over the years they
mastered the art of dissimulation, displaying cmcifixes liberally, giving
generous gifts to churches, even occasionally making anti-Semitic
rema.rks—~and all the while maintaining their inner freedom and beliefs.

In society, the Man-anos knew, outward appearances are what matter.
This remains true today. The strategy is simple: As Campanella did in writ-
ing Atheism Conquered, make a show of blending in, even going so far as to
be the most zealous advocate of the prevailing orthodoxy. If you stick to
conventional appearances in public few will believe you think differently
in private.

Do not be so foolish as to imagine that in our own time the old ortho—
doxies are gone. Jonas Salk, for instance, thought science had gotten past
politics and protocol. And so, in his search for a polio vaccine, he broke all
the rules--going public with a discovery before showing it to the scientific
community, taking credit for the vaccine without acknowledging the scien-
tists who had paved the way, making himself a star. The public may have
loved him but scientists shunned him. His disrespect for his community’s
orthodoxies left him isolated, and he wasted years trying to heal
the
breach, and struggling for funding and cooperation.

Un—American Activities Committee-and approached it with considerable
canniness. Having worked off and on in the American film industry during
World War II, in 1947 Brecht was summoned to appear before the commit-
tee to answer quesfions on his suspected Communist sympathies. Other
writers called before the committee made a point of attacking its members,
and of acting as belligerently as possible in order to gain sympathy for
themselves. Brecht, on the other hand, who had actually worked stead»
lastly for the Communist cause, played the opposite game: He answered
questions with ambiguous generalities that defied easy interpretation. Call
it the Carnpanella strategy. Brecht even were a suit————a rare event for him—-
and made a point of smoking a cigar during the proceedings, knowing that
akey committee member had a passion for cigars. In the end he charmed
the committee members, who let him go scobfree.

Brecht then moved to East Germany, where he encountered a differ-
ent kind of Inquisition. Here the Communists were in power, and they crit»
icized his plays as decadent and pessimistic. He did not argue with them,
but made small changes in the performance scripts to shut them up. Mean«
while he managed to preserve the published texts as written. His outward
conformity in both cases gave him the freedom to work unhindered, with
out having to change his thinking. In the end, he made his way safely
through dangerous times in different countries through the use of little
dances of orthodoxy, and proved he was more powerful than the forces of
repression.

Not only do people of power avoid the offenses of Pausanias and Salk,
they also learn to play the clever fox and feign the common touch. This has
been the ploy of con artists and politicians throughout the centuries. Lead-
ers like Julius Caesar and Franklin D. Roosevelt have overcome their nab
ural aristocratic stance to cultivate a familiarity with the common man.
They have expressed this familiarity in little gestures, often symbolic, to
show the people that their leaders share popular values, despite their differ-
ent status.

The logical extension of this practice is the invaluable ability to be all
things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your own
ideas and values, and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the
group in which you find yourself. Bismarck played this game successfully
for yearsmthere were people who vaguely understood what he was up to,
but not clearly enough that it mattered. People will swallow the bait be-
cause it flatters them to believe that you share their ideas. They will not
take you as a hypocrite if you are careful~——for how can they accuse you of
hypocrisy if you do not let them know exactly what you stand for? Nor will
they see you as lacking in values. Of course you have values~——the values
you share with them, while in their company.

Authority: Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw
lest they trample them under
your pearls before swine,

REVE RSAL
The only time it is worth standing out is when you already stand out-
when you have achieved an unshakable position of power, and can display
your difference from others as a sign of the distance between you. As pres—
ident of the United States, Lyndon Johnson would sometimes hold meet-
ings while he sat on the toilet. Since no one else either could or would
claim such a “privilege,” Johnson was showing people that he did not have
to observe the protocols and nicefies of others. The Roman emperor
Caligula played the same game: He would wear a woman’s negligee, or a
bathrobe, to receive important visitors. He even went so far as to have his
horse elected consul. But it backfired, for the people hated Caligula, and
his gestures eventually brought his overthrow. The truth is that even those
who attain the heights of power would be better off at least affecting the
common touch, for at some point they may need popular support.

Finally, there is always a place for the gadfly, the person who success-
fully defies custom and mocks what has grown lifeless in a culture. Oscar
Wilde, for example, achieved considerable social power on this founda-
tion: He made it clear that he disdained the usual ways of doing things, and
when he gave public readings his audiences not only expected him to in-
sult them but welcomed it We notice, however, that his eccentric role
eventually destroyed him. Even had he come to a better end, remember
that he possessed an unusual genius: Without his gift to amuse and delight,
his barbs would simply have offended people.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In January of 1809, an agitated and anxious Napoleon hurried back to
Paris from his Spanish wars. His spies and confidants had confirmed a
rumor that his foreign minister Talleyrand had conspired against him with
Fouché, the minister of police. Immediately on arriving in the capital the
shocked emperor summoned his ministers to the palace. Following them
into the meeting right after their arrival, he began pacing up and down,
and started rambling vaguely about plotters working against him, specula-
tors bringing down the stock market, legislators delaying his policies—a.nd
his own ministers undermining him.

As Napoleon talked, Talleyrand leaned on the mantelpiece, looking
completely indifferent. Facing Talleyrand directly, Napoleon announced,
“For these ministers, treason has begun when they permit themselves to
doubt.” At the word “treason” the ruler expected his minister to be afraid.
But Talleyrand only smiled, calm and bored.

The sight of a subordinate apparently serene in the face of charges that
could get him hanged pushed Napoleon to the edge. There were ministers,
he said, who wanted him dead, and he took a step closer to Talleyrand—
who stared back at him unfazed. Finally Napoleon exploded. “You are a
coward,” he screamed in Talleyrand’s face, “a man of no faith. Nothing is
sacred to you. You would sell your own father. I have showered you with
riches and yet there is nothing you would not do to hurt me.” The other
ministers looked at each other in disbelief—they had never seen this fear-
less general, the conqueror of most of Europe, so unhinged.

.

“You deserve to be broken like glass,” Napoleon continued, stamping.
“I have the power to do it, but I have too much contempt for you to bother.
Why didn’t I have you hanged from the gates of the Tuileries? But there is
still time for that.” Yelling, almost out of breath, his face red, his eyes
bulging, he went on, “You, by the way, are nothing but shit in a silk stock-
. What about your wife? You never told me that San Carlos was your
ing. .
wife’s lover?” “Indeed, sire, it did not occur to me that this information had
any bearing on Your Majesty’s glory or my own,” said Talleyrand calmly,
completely unflustered. After a few more insults, Napoleon walked away.
Talleyrand slowly crossed the room, moving with his characteristic limp.
As an attendant helped him with his cloak, he turned to his fellow ministers
(all afraid they would never see him again), and said, “What a pity, gentle
men, that so great a man should have such bad manners.”

Despite his anger, Napoleon Hid not arrest his foreign minister. He
merely relieved him of his duties
d banished him from the court, believ-
ing that for this man humiliation would be punishment enough. He did not
realize that word had quickly spread of his tirade—of how the emperor had
completely lost control of himself, and how Talleyrand had essentially hu-
miliated him by maintaining his composure and dignity. A page had been
turned: For the first time people had seen the great emperor lose his cool
under fire. A feeling spread that he was on the way down. As Talleyrand
later said, “This is the beginning of the end.”

Interpretation
This was indeed the beginning of the end. Waterloo was still six years
ahead, but Napoleon was on a slow descent to defeat, ciystallizing in 1812
with his disastrous invasion of Russia. Talleyrand was the first to see the
signs of his decline, especially in the irrational war with Spain. Sometime in
1808, the minister decided that for the future peace of Europe, Napoleon
had to go. And so he conspired with Fouché.

It is possible that the conspiracy was never anything more than a
ploy~—a device to push Napoleon over the edge. For it is hard to believe
that two of the most practical men in history would only go halfway in their
plotting. They may have been only stirring the waters, trying to goad
Napoleon into a misstep. And indeed, what they got was the tarrtmrn that
laid out his loss of control for all to see. In fact, Napoleorfs soon—famous
blowup that afternoon had a profoundly negative effect on his public
image.

This is the problem with the angry response. At first it may strike fear
and terror, but only in some, and as the days pass and the storm clears,
the
responses erne:ge—embar1:assment and uneasiness about
other
shouter’s capacity for going out of control, and resentment of what has
been said. Losing your temper, you always make unfair and exaggerated
accusations. A few such tirades and people are counting the days until you
are gone.

In the face of a conspiracy against him, a conspiracy between his two
most important ministers, Napoleon certainly had a right to feel angry and
anxious. But by responding so angrily, and so publicly, he only demon-
strated his frustration. To show your frustration is to show that you have
lost your power to shape events; it is the helpless action of the child who re-
sorts to a hysterical fit to get his way. The powerful never reveal this kind of
weakness.

There were a number of things Napoleon could have done in this situ~
alien. He could have thought about the fact that two eminently sensible
men had had reason to turn against him, and could have listened and
learned from them. He could have tried to win them back to him. He could
even have gotten rid of them, making their imprisonment or dead; an omi-
nous display of his power. No tirades, no childish fits, no embarrassing
afler-elfects—just a quiet and definitive severing of ties.

Remember: Tantrums neither intimidate nor inspire loyalty. They
only create doubts and uneasiness about your power. Exposing your weak’
ness, these stormy eruptions often herald a. fall.

in his way: the empress and her husband, Ras Gugsa. Selassie knew the
royal couple hated him and wanted to get rid of him, so to cut short their
plotting he made Gugsa the governor of the northern province of
Begemeder, forcing him to leave the capital, where the empress lived.

For several years Gugsa played the loyal administrator. But Selassie
did not trust him: He knew that Gugsa and the empress were plotting re-
venge. As time passed and Gugsa made no move, the chances of a plot
only increased. Selassie knew what he had to do: draw Gugsa out, get
under his skin, and push him into action before he was ready.

For several years, a northern tribe, the Azebu Gallas, had been in vir»

refusing to pay taxes. Selassie had done nothing to stop them, letting them
grow stronger. Finally, in 1929, he ordered Ras Gugsa to lead an anny

seethed--he had no gmdge against the Azebu Gallas, and the demand that
he fight them hurt his pride. He could not disobey the order, but as he
worked to put together an army, he began to spread an ugly rumor«-that
Selassie was in cahoois with the pope, and planned to convert the country
to Roman Catholicism and make it a colony ofItaly. Gugsifs army swelled,
and some of the tribes from which its soldiers came secretly agreed to fight
Selassie. In March of 1930 an enormous force of 35,000 men began to
march, not on the Azebu Gallas but souih, toward the capital of Addis
Ababa. Made confident by his growing strength, Gugsa. now openly led a
holy war to depose Selassie and put the country back in the hands of true
Christians.

He did not see the trap that had been laid for him. Before Selassie had
ordered Gugsa to fight the Azebu Gallas, he had secured the support of the
Ethiopian church. And before the revolt got underway, he had bribed sev-
eral of Gugsa’s key allies not to show up for battle. As the rebel army
marched south, airplanes flew overhead dropping leaflets announcing that
the highest church officials had recognized Selassie as the tme Christian
leader of Ethiopia, and that they had excommunicated Gugsa for foment-
ing a civil war. These leaflets severely blunted the emotions behind the
holy crusade. And as battle loomed and the support that Gugsa’s allies had
promised him failed to show up, soldiers began to flee or defect.

When the battle came, the rebel army quicky collapsed. Refusing to
surrender, Ras Gugsa was killed in the fighting. The empress, distraught
over her l1usba.nd’s death, died a few days later. On April 80, Selassie is-
sued a formal proclamation announcing his new title: Emperor of Ethiopia.

Interpretation
Haile Selassie always saw several moves ahead. He knew that if he let Ras
Gugsa decide the time and place of the revolt, the danger would be much
greaier than if he forced Gngsa to act on Selassie’s terms. So he goaded him
into rebellion by offending his manly pride, asking him to fight people he
had no quarrel with on behalf of a man he hated. Thinking everything out

This is the essence of the Law: When the waters are still, your oppo~
nents have the time and space to plot actions that they will initiate and com
trol. So stir the waters, force the fish to the surface, get them to act before
they are ready, steal the initiative. The best way to do this is to play on un-
controllable emotions—-pride, vanity, love, hate. Once the water is stirred
up, the little fish cannot help but rise to the bait. The angrier they become,
the less control they have, and finally they are caught in the whirlpool you
have made, and they drown.

A sovereign should never launch an army out ofanger.
a leader should never start a war out ofurrath.
Sun-zzu, fourth cmlury .li.C.

KEYS TO POWER
Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems
out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have taken things too seri-
ously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been done to them. They are
so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical how much they take person~
ally. More comical still is their belief that their outbursts signify power: The
truth is the opposite: Fetulance is not power, it is a sign of helplessness.
People may temporarily be cowed by your tantrums, but in the end they
lose respect for you. They also realize they can easily undermine a person
with so little selflcontrol.

The answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional re
sponses. For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into strange be-
havior. lnstead we have to change our perspective: We have to realize that
nothing in the social realm, and in the game of power, is personal.

Everyone is caught up in a chain of events that long predates the pre-
sent moment. Our anger often stems from problems in our childhood,
from the problems of our parents which stem from their own childhood, on
and on. Our anger also has roots in the many interactions with others, the
accumulated disappointments and heartaches that we have suffered. An in-
dividual will often appear as the instigator of our anger but it is much more
complicated, goes far beyond what that individual did to us. If a person ex-
plodes with anger at you (and it seems out of proportion to what you did to
them), you must remind yourself that it is not exclusively directed at you-—
do not be so vain. The cause is much larger, goes way bad: in time, in-
volves dozens of prior hurts, and is actually not worth the bother to
understand. Instead of seeing it as a personal grudge, look at the emotional
outburst as a disguised power move, an attempt to control or punish you
cloaked in the form of hurt feelings and anger.

This shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with more
clarity and energy. Instead of overreasting, and becoming ensnared in pet)»

keep your head while they are losing theirs.

During an important battle in the War of the Three Kingdoms, in the
third century A.D., advisers to the commander Ts’ao Ts’ao discovered docu»
ments showing that certain of his generals had conspired with the enemy,
and urged him to arrest and execute them. Instead he ordered the docu-
ments burned and the matter forgotten. At this critical moment in the bat-
tle, to get upset or demand justice would have reverberated against him:
An angry action would have called attention to the generals’ disloyalty,
which would have harmed the troops’ morale. justice could wait-he
would deal with the generals in time. Ts‘ao Ts’ao kept his head and made
the right decision.

Compare this to Napoleon&#x27;s response to Talleyrand: Instead of taking
the conspiracy personally, the emperor should have played the game like
Ts’ao Ts’ao, carefully weighing the consequences of any action he took.
The more powerful response in the end would have been to ignore Tal~
leyr-and, or to bring the minister gradually back to his side and punish him
later.

Anger only cuts off our options, and the powerful cannot thrive with
out options. Once you train yourself not to take matters personally, and to
control your emotional responses, you will have placed yourself in a posi-
tion of tremendous power: Now you can play with the emotional responses
of other people. Stir the insecure into action by impugning their manhood,
and by dangling the prospect of an easy victory before their faces. Do as
Houdini did when challenged by the less successful escape artist Kleppini:
Reveal an apparent weakness (Houdini let Kleppini steal the combination
for a pair of cuffs) to hire your opponent into action. Then you can beat
him with ease. With the arrogant too you can appear weaker than you are,
taunting them into a rash action.

Sun Pin, commander of the armies of Ch’i and loyal disciple of Sun-
tzu, once led his troops against the armies of Wei, which outnumbered him
two to one. “Let us light a hundred thousand fires when our army enters
Wei,” suggested Sun Pin, “fifty thousand on the next day, and only thirty
thousand on the third.” On the third day the Wei general exclaimed, “I
knew the men of Ch’i were cowards, and after only three days more than
half of them have deserted!” So, leaving behind his slow-moving heavy in
fantry, the general decided to seize the moment and move swiftly on the
Ch’i camp with a lightly armed force. Sun Pin’s troops retreated, luring
Wei’s army into a narrow pass, where they ambushed and destroyed them.
With the Wei general dead and his forces decimated, Sun Pin now easily
defeated the rest of his army.

In the face of a hot—headed enemy, finally, an excellent response is no
response. Follow the Talleyrand tactic: Nothing is as infuriating as a man
who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs. If it will work to your ad-
vantage to unsettle people, affect the aristocratic, bored pose, neither
mocking nor triumphant but simply indifferent. This will light their fuse.

The leaders of the city of Tyre, capital of ancient Phoenicia, felt confl-
dent they could withstand Alexander the Great, who had conquered the
Oiient but had not attacked their city, which stood well protected on the
water. They sent ambassadors to Alexander saying that although they
would recognize him as emperor they would not allow him or his forces to
enter Tyre. This of course enraged him, and he immediately mounted a
siege. For four months the city withstood him, and finally he decided that
the struggle was not worth it, and that he would come to terms with the
Tyrians. But they, feeling that they had already baited Alexander and got-
ten away with it, and confident that they could withstand him, refused to

negotiate«—-in. fact they killed his messengers,

This pushed Alexander over the edge. Now it did not matter to him
how long the siege lasted or how large an army it needed; he had the re-
sources, and would do whatever it took He remounted his assault so siren-
uously that he captured Tyre within days, burned it to the ground, and sold
its people into slavery.

You can bait the powerful and get them to commit and divide their
forces as Sun Pin did, but test the waters first. Find the gap in their strength.
If there is no gap--if they are impossibly strong——you have nothing to gain
and everything to lose by provoking them. Choose carefully whom you
bait, and never stir up the sharks.

Finally there are times when a we1l—timed burst of anger can do you
good, but your anger must be manufactured and under your control. Then
you can determine exactly how and on whom it will fall. Never stir up re
actions that will work against you in the long run. And use your thunder
bolts rarely, to make them the more intimidating and meaningful. Whether
purposefully staged or not, if your outbursts come too often, they will lose
their power.

MONEY AND POWER
In the realm of power, everything must be judged by its cost, and every-
thing has a price. What is offered for free or at bargain rates often comes
with a. psychological pn’ce tag—-complicated feelings of obligation, com-
promises with quality, the insecurity those compromises bring, on and on.
The powerful learn early to protect their most valuable resources: indepen-
dence and room to maneuver. By paying the full price, they keep them-
selves free of dangerous entanglements and worries.

Being open and flexible with money also teaches the value of strategic
generosity, a variation on the old trick of “giving when you are about to
take.” By giving the appropriate gift, you put the recipient under obliga-
tion. Generosity softens people up——to be deceived. By gaining a reputa-
tion for liberality, you win people’: admiration while distracting them from
your power plays. By strategically spreading your wealth, you charm the
other courtiers, creating pleasure and making valuable allies.

Look at the masters of power——the Caesars, the Queen Elizabeths, the
Michelangelos, the Mecljcis: Not a miser among them. Even the great con
artists spend freely to swindle. Tight purse strings are unattractive——when
engaged in seduction, Casanova would give completely not only of himself
but of his wallet. The powerful understand that money is psychologically
charged, and that it is also a vessel of politeness and sociability. They make
the human side of money a weapon in their armory.

For everyone able to play with money, thousands more are locked in a
self-destructive refusal to use money creatively and strategically. These
types represent the opposite pole to the powerful, and you must learn to
recognize them-——either to avoid their poisonous natures or to turn their in-
flexibility to your advantage:

The Greedy Fish. The greedy fish take the human side out of money.
Cold and ruthless, they see only the lifeless balance sheet; viewing others
solely as either pawns or obstructions in their pursuit of wealth, they tram-
ple on people’s sentiments and alienate valuable allies. No one wanis to
work with the greedy fish, and over the years they end up isolated, which
ofien proves their undoing.

Greedy fish are the con a.rtist’s bread and butter: Lured by the bait of
easy money, they swallow the ruse hook, line, and sinker. They are easy to
deceive, for they spend so much time dealing with numbers (not with peer
ple) that they become blind to psychology, including their own. Either
avoid them before they exploit you or play on their greed to your gain.

The Bargain Demon. Powerful people judge everything by what it costs,
not just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind. And this is ex»
actly what Bargain Demons cannot do. Wasting valuable time digging for
bargains, they worry endlessly about what they could have gotten else
where for a little less. On top of that, the bargain item they do buy is often
shabby; perhaps it needs costly repairs, or will have to be replaced twice as

fast as a high-quality item. The costs of these pursuits-——not always in
money (though the price of a bargain is often deceptive) but in time and
peace of mind—discoura.ge normal people from undertaking them, but for
the Bargain Demon the bargain is an end in itself.

These types might seem to harm only themselves, but their attitudes
are contagious: Unless you resist them they will infect you with the inse~
cure feeling that you should have looked harder to find a cheaper price.
Don’t argue with them or try to change them. just mentally add up the

hm KHAi,i&gt;17~N.
1332-1406

The Sadist. Financial sadists play vicious power games with money as a
way of asserting their power. They might, for example, make you wait for
money that is owed you, promising you that the check is in the mail. Or if
they hire you to work for them, they meddle in every aspect of the job,
haggling and giving you ulcers. Sadists seem to think that paying for some
thing gives them the right to torture and abuse the seller. They have no
sense of the couriier element in money. If you are unlucky enough to get
involved with this type, accepting a financial loss may be better in the long
run than getting entangled in their destructive power games.

The Indiscriminate Giver. Generosity has a definite function in power:
It attracts people, softens them up, makes allies out of them. But it has to be
used strategically, with a. definite end in mind. Indiscriminate Givers, on
the other hand, are generous because they want to be loved and admired
by all. And their generosity is so indiscriminate and needy that it may not
have the desired effect: If they give to one and all. why should the recipient
feel special? Attractive as it may seem to make an Indiscriminate Giver
your mark, in any involvement with this type you will often feel burdened
by their insatiable emotional needs.

TRANSGRESSIONS OF THE LAW

After Francisco Pizarro conquered Peru, in 1532, gold from the Incan Em-
pire began to pour into Spain, and Spaniards of all classes started dreaming
of the instant riches to be had in the New World. The story soon spread of
an Indian chief to the east of Peru who once each year would ritually cover
himself in gold dust and dive into a lake. Soon word of mouth transformed
El Damrio, the “Golden Man,” into an empire called El Dorado, wealthier
than the Incan, where the streets were paved and the buildings inlaid with
gold. This elaboration of the story did not seem implausible, for surely a
chief who could afiord to waste gold dust in a lake must rule a golden em-
pire. Soon Spaniards were searching for El Dorado all over northern South
America.

In February of 1541, the largest expedition yet in this venture, led by
Piza.rr0’s brother Gonzalo, left Quito, in Ecuador. Resplendent in their ar-
mors and colorful silks, 340 Spaniards headed east, along with 4,000 Indi-
ans to carry supplies and serve as scouts, 4,000 swine, dozens of llamas,
and close to 1,000 dogs. But the expedition was soon hit by torrential rain,
which rotted its gear and spoiled its food. Meanwhile, as Gonzalo Pizarro
questioned the Indians they met along the way, those who seemed to be
withholding information, or who had not even heard of the fabulous king-
dom, he would torture and feed to the dogs. Word of the Spaniards’ mur-
derousness spread quickly among the Indians, who realized that the only
way to avoid Gonzalds wrath was to make up stories about El Dorado
and send him as far away as possible. As Gonzalo and his men followed
the leads the Indians gave them, then, they were only led farther into deep
jungle.

The explorers’ spirits sagged. Their uniforms had long since shredded;
their armor rusted and they threw it away; their shoes were torn to pieces,
forcing them to walk barefoot; the Indian slaves they had set out with had
either died or deserted them; they had eaten not only the svsnne but the
hunting dogs and llamas. They lived on roots and fruit. Realizing that they
could not continue this way, Pizarro decided to risk river travel, and a
barge was built out of rotting wood. But the journey down the treacherous
Napo River proved no easier. Setting up camp on the n‘ver’s edge, Gonzalo
sent scouts ahead on the barge to find Indian settlements with food. He
waited and waited for the scouts to return, only to find out they had de-
cided to desert the expedition and continue down the river on their own.

The rain continued without end. Gonzalo’s men forgot about El Do-
rado; they wanted only to return to Quito. Finally, in August of 1542, a lit-
tle over a hundred men, from an expedition originally numbering in the
thousands, managed to find their way back. To the residents of Quito they
seemed to have emerged from hell itself, wrapped in tatters and skins, their
bodies covered in sores, and so emaciated as to be unrecognizable. For
over a year and a half they had marched in an enormous circle, two thou-
sand miles by foot. The vast sums of money invested in the expedition had
yielded nothing-—no sign of El Dorado and no sign of gold.
interpretation
Even after Gonzalo Pizano’s disaster, the Spaniards launched expedition
after expedition in Search of El Dorado. And like Pizarro the conquistadors
would burn and loot villages, torture Indians, endure unimaginable hard-
ships, and get no closer to gold. The money they spent on such expeditions
cannot be calculated; yet despite the futility of the search, the lure of the
fantasy endured.

Not only did the search for El Dorado cost millions of lives——both In»
dian and Spanish—it helped bring the ruin of the Spanish empire. Gold be-
came Spain’s obsession. The gold that did find its way back to Spain——and
a lot clid~—was reinvested in more expeditions, or in the purchase of luxu-
ries, rather than in agriculture or any other productive endeavor. Whole
Spanish towns were depopulated as their menfolk left to hunt gold. Farms

end of the seventeenth century, the entire country had shrunk by more
than half of its population; the city of Madrid had gone from a population
of 400,000 to 150,000. With diminishing returns from its efforts over so
many years, Spain fell into a decline from which it never recovered.

Transgression ll
In the early eighteenth century, no one stood higher in English society
than the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. The duke, having led sue»
cessful campaigns against the French, was considered Europe’s premier
general and strategist. And his wife, the duchess, after much maneuvering,
had established herself as the favorite of Queen Anne, who became ruler
of England in 1702. In 1704 the duke’s triumph at the Battle of Blenheim
made him the toast of England, and to honor him the queen awarded him
a large plot of land in the town of Woodstock, and the funds to create a
great palace there. Calling his planned home the Palace of Blenheim, the
duke chose as his architect the young john Vanbrugh, a kind of Renais-
sance man who wrote plays as well as designed buildings. And so con—
in the summer of 1705, with much fanfare and great
struction began,

Vanbrugh had a dramatist’s sense of architecture. His palace was to be
a monument to Mar1borough’s brilliance and power, and was to include
artificial
lakes, enormous bridges, elaborate gardens, and other fantastical
touches. From day one, however, the duchess could not be pleased: She
thought Vanbrugh was wasting money on yet another stand of trees; she
wanted the palace finished as soon as possible. The duchess tortured Van~
brugh and his workmen on every detail. She was consumed with petty
matters; although the government was paying for Blenheim, she counted
every penny. Eventually her grumbling, about Blenheim and other things
too, created an irreparable rift between her and Queen Anne, who, in 1711,
dismissed her from the court, ordering her to vacate her apartments at the
royal palace. When the duchess left (fuming over the loss of her position,
and also of her royal salary), she emptied the apartment of every fixture
down to the brass doorknobs.

Over the next ten years, work on Blenheim would stop and start, as
the funds became harder to procure from the government. The duchess

thought Vanbrugh was out to ruin her. She quibbled over every carload of
stone and bushel of lime, counted every extra yard of iron railing or foot of
wainscot, hurling abuse at the wasteful workmen, contractors, and survey-
ors. Marlborough, old and weaiy, wanted nothing more than to settle into
the palace in his last years, but the project became bogged down in a
swamp of litigation, the workmen suing the duchess for wages, the duchess
suing the architect right back. In the midst of this interminable wrangling,
the duke died. He had never spent a night in his beloved Blenheim.

After Ma.rlborough’s death, it became clear that he had a vast estate,
worth over £2 million—-more than enough to pay for finishing the palace.
But the duchess would not relent: She held back Vanbrugh’s wages as well
as the workmerfs, and finally had the architect dismissed. The man who
took his place finished Blenheim in a few years, following Vanbruglfs de-
signs to the letter. Vanbrugh died in 1726, locked out of the palace by the
duchess, unable to set foot in his greatest creation. Foreshadowing the ro-
mantic movement, Blenheim had started a whole new trend in architec-
ture, but had given its creator a twenty—year nightmare.
Interpretation
For the Duchess of Marlborough, money was a way to play sadistic power
games. She saw the loss of money as a symbolic loss of power. With Van-
brugh her contortions went deeper still: He was a great artist, and she en~
vied his power to create, to attain a fame outside her reach. She may not
have had his gifts, but she did have the money to torture and abuse him
over the pettiest details—to ruin his life.

This kind of sadism, however, bears an awful price. It made construe»
tion that should have lasted ten years take twenty. It poisoned many a rela-
tionship, alienated the duchess from the court. deeply pained the duke
(who wanted only to live peacefully in Blenheim), created endless lawsuits,
and took years off Vanbruglfs life. Finally, too, posterity had the last word:
Vanbrugh is recognized as a genius while the duchess is forever remem«
bered for her consummate cheapness.

The powerful must have grandeur of spirit»-they can never reveal any
petfiness. And money is the most visible arena in which to display either
grandeur or pettiness. Best spend freely, then, and create a reputation for
generosity, which in the end will pay great dividends. Never let financial
details blind you to the bigger picture of how people perceive you. Their
resentment will cost you in the long run. And if you want to meddle in the
work of creative people under your hire, at least pay them well. Your
money will buy their submission better than your displays of power.

OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW

Observance I
Pietro Aretino, son of a lowly shoemaker, had catapulted himself into fame
as a writer of biting satires. But like every Renaissance artist, he needed to
find a patron who would give him a comfortable lifestyle while not inter

fering with his work. In 1528 Aretino decided to attempt a new strategy in
the patronage game. Leaving Rome, he established himself in Venice,
where few had heard of him. He had a fair amount of money he had man-
aged to save, but little else. Soon after he moved into his new home, how-
ever, he flirew open its doors to rich and poor, regaling them with
banquets and amusements. He befriended each and every gondolier, tip-
ping them royally. In the streets, he spread his money liberally, giving it
away to beggars, orphans, Washerwomen. Among the city’s commoners,
word quickly spread that Aretino was more than just a great writer, he was
a man of power—-a kind of lord.

Artists and men of influence soon began to frequent Areu‘no’s house.
Within a few years he made himself a celebrity; no visiting dignitary would
think of leaving Venice without paying him a call. His generosity had cost
him most of his savings, but had bought him influence and a good name—
a cornerstone in the foundation of power. Since in Renaissance Italy as
elsewhere the ability to spend freely was the privilege of the rich, the arisv
tocracy thought Aretino had to be a man of influence, since he spent
money like one. And since the influence of a man of influence is worth
buying, Aretino became the recipient of all sorts of gifts and moneys.
Dukes and duchesses, wealthy merchants, and popes and princes com-
peted to gain his favor, and showered him with all kinds of presents.

Aretino’s spending habits, of course, were strategic, and the strategy
worked like a charm. But for real money and comfort he needed a great
patron’s bottomless pockets. Having surveyed the possibilities, he eventu-
ally set his sights on the extremely wealthy Marquis of Mantua, and wrote
an epic poem that he dedicated to the marquis. This was a common prac-
tice of writers looking for patronage: In exchange for a dedication they
would get a small stipend, enough to write yet another poem, so that they
spent their lives in a kind of constant servility. Aretino, however, wanted
power, not a measly wage. He might dedicate a poem to the marquis, but
he would offer it to him as a gift, implying by doing so that he was not a
hired hack looking for a stipend but that he and the marquis were equals.

Aret.ino’s gift-giving did not stop there: As a close friend of two of
Venice’s greatest artists, the sculptor Jacopo Sansovino and the painter
Titian, he convinced these men to participate in his gift-giving scheme.
Aretino had studied the marquis before going to work on him, and knew
his taste inside and out; he was able to advise Sansovirio and Titian what
subject matter would please the marquis most. When he then sent a Sanso-
vino sculpture and a Titian painting to the marquis as gifts from all three of
them, the man was beside himself with joy.

Over the next few months, Aretino sent other gifts——swords, saddles,
the glass that was a Venetian specialty, things he knew the marquis prized.
Soon he, Titian, and Sansovino began to receive gifts from the marquis in
return. And the strategy went further: When the son-in—law of a friend of
Aretino’s found himself in jail in Mantua, Aretino was able to get the mar-
quis to arrange his release. Aretinds friend, a wealthy merchant, was a
man of great influence in Venice; by turning the goodwill he had built up

with the marquis to use, Aretino had now bought this man’s indebtedness,
too, and he in turn would help Aretino when he could. The circle of influ-
ence was growing wider. Time and again, Aretino was able to cash in on
the immense political power of the marquis, who also helped him in his
many court romances.

Eventually, however,

the relationship became strained, as Aretino
came to feel that the marquis should have requited his generosity better.
But he would not lower himself to begging or whining: Since the exchange
of gifts between the two men had made them equals, it would not seem
right to bring up money. He simply withdrew from the marquis’s circle and
hunted for other wealthy prey, settling first on the French king Francis,
then the Medicis, the Duke of Urbino, Emperor Charles V, and more. In
the end, having many patrons meant he did not have to bow to any of
them, and his power seemed comparable to that of a great lord.
Interpretation
Aretino understood two fundamental properties of money: First, that it has
to circulate to bring power. What money should buy is not lifeless objects
but power over people. By keeping money in constant circulation, Aretino
bought an ever—expanding circle of influence that in the end more than
compensated him for his expenses.

Second, Aretino understood the key property of the gift. To give a gift
is to imply that you and the recipient are equals at the very least, or that
you are the recipient’s superior. A gift also involves an indebtedness or
obligation; when friends, for instance, offer you something for free, you
can be sure they expect something in return, and that to get it they are
indebted. (The mechanism may or may not be entirely
making you feel
conscious on their paxt, but this is how it works.)

Aretino avoided such encumbrances on his freedom. Instead of acting
like a menial who expects the powerful to pay his way in life, he turned the
whole dynamic around; instead of being indebted to the powerful, he
made the powerful indebted to him. This was the point of his gift-giving, a
ladder that carried him to the highest social levels. By the end of his life he
had become the most famous writer in Europe.

Understand: Money may determine power relationships, but those re-
lationships need not depend on the amount of money you have; they also
depend on the way you use it Powerful people give freely, buying influ-
ence rather them things. If you accept the inferior position because you
have no fortune yet, you may find yourself in it forever. Play the trick that
Aretino played on Ita.ly’s aristocracy: Imagine yourself an equal. Play the
lord, give freely, open your doors, circulate your money, and create the fa-
cade of power through an alchemy that transforms money into influence.

Observance II
Soon after Baron James Rothschild made his fortune in Paris in the early
1820s, he faced his most intractable problem: How could ajew and 3. Ger
man, a total outsider to French society, win the respect of the xenophobic
French upper classes? Rothschild was a man who understood power--—he

knew that his fortune would bring him status, but that if he remained so
cially alienated neither his status nor his fortune would last. So he looked at
the society of the time and asked what would win their hearts.

Charity? The French couldn’t care less. Political influence? He already
had that, and if anything it only made people more suspicious of him. The
one weak spot, he decided, was boredom. In the period of the restoration
of the monarchy,
the French upper classes were bored. So Rothschild
began to spend astounding sums of money on entertaining them. He hired
the best architects in France to design his gardens and ballroom; he hired
Marie-Antoine Caréme, the most celebrated French chef, to prepare the
most lavish parties Paris had ever witnessed; no Frenchman could resist,
even if the parties were given by a German Jew. Rothschild’s weekly
soirées began to attract bigger and bigger numbers. Over the next few
years he won the only thing that would secure an outsider’s power: social
acceptance.
Interpretation
Strategic generosity is always a great weapon in building a support base,
particularly for the outsider. But the Baron de Rothschild was cleverer still:
He knew it was his money that had created the barrier between him and
the French, making him look ugly and untrustworthy. The best way to
overcome this was literally to waste huge sums, a gesture to show he valued
French culture and society over money. What Rothschild did resembled
die famous potlatch feasts of the American Northwest: By periodically de-
stroying its wealth in a giant orgy of festivals and bonfires, an Indian tribe
would symbolize its power over other tribes. The base of its power was not
money but its ability to spend, and its confidence in a superiority that
would restore to it all that the potlatch had destroyed.

In the end, the baron’s soirées reflected his desire to mingle not just in
France’s business world but in its society. By wasting money on his pet-
latches, he hoped to demonstrate that his power went beyond money into
the more precious realm of culture. Rothschild may have won social accep-
tance by spending money, but the support base he gained was one that
money alone could not buy. To secure his fortune he had to “waste” it. That
is strategic generosity in a nutshell——the ability to be flexible with your
wealth, putting it to work, not to buy objects, but to win people’s hearts.

Observance III
The Medicis of Renaissance Florence had built their immense power on
the fortune they had made in banking. But in Florence, centuries—old re-
public that it was, the idea that money bought power went against all the
city’s proud democratic Values. Cosimo de’ Medici, the first of the family to
gain great fame, worked around this by keeping a low profile. He never
flaunted his wealth. But by the time his grandson Lorenzo came of age, in
the 1470s, the family’s wealth was too large, and their influence we notice-
able, to be disguised any longer.

Lorenzo solved the problem in his own way by developing the strat-
egy of distraction that has served people of wealth ever since: He became

the most illustrious patron of the arts that history has ever known. Not only
did he spend lavishly on paintings, he created Italy’s finest apprentice
schools for young artists. It was in one of these schools that the young
Michelangelo first caught the attention of Lorenzo, who invited the artist to
come and live in his house. He did the same with Leonardo da Vinci. Once
under his wing, Michelangelo and Leonardo requited his generosity by be»
coming loyal artists in his stable.

Whenever Lorenzo faned an enemy, he would wield the weapon of
patronage. When Pisa, Florence’s traditional enemy, threatened to rebel
against it in 1472, Lorenzo placated its people by pouring money into its
university, which had once been its pride and joy but had long ago lost its
luster. The Pisans had no defense against this insidious maneuver, which si-
multaneously fed their love of culture and blunted their desire for battle.
Interpretation
Lorenzo undoubtedly loved the arts, but his patronage of artists had a prac-
tical function as well, of which he was keenly aware. In Florence at the
time, banking was perhaps the least admired way of making money, and
was certainly not a respected source of power. The arts were at the other
pole, the pole of qua.si—religious transcendence. By spending on the arts,
Lorenzo diluted people’s opinions of the ugly source of his wealth, disguis-
ing himself in nobility. There is no better use of strategic generosity than
that of distracting attention from an unsavory reality and wrapping oneself
in the mantle of art or religion.

Observance IV
Louis XIV had an eagle eye for the strategic power of money. When he
came to the throne, the powerful nobility had recently proven a thump in
the monarchy’s side, and seethed with rebelliousness. So he impoverished
these aristocrats by making them spend enormous sums on maintaining
their position in the court. Making them dependent on royal largesse for
their livelihood, he had them in his claws.

Next Louis brought the nobles to their knees with strategic generosity.
It would work like this: Vtlhenever he noticed a stubborn courtier whose in-
fluence he needed to gain, or whose troublemaking he needed to squelch,
he would use his vast wealth to soften the soil. First he would ignore his vic-
tim, making the man anxious. Then the man would suddenly find that his
son had been given a well»paid post, or that funds had been spent liberally
in his home region, or that he had been given a painting he had long cov-
eted. Presents would flow from Louis’s hands. Finally, weeks or months
later, Louis would ask for the favor he had needed all along. A man who
had once vowed to do anything to stop the king would find he had lost the
desire to fight. A straightforward bribe would have made him rebellious;
this was far more insidious. Facing hardened earth in which nothing could
take root, Louis loosened the soil before he planted his seeds.
Interpretation
Louis understood that there is a. deep-rooted emotional element in our atti-
tude to money, an element going back to childhood. When we are chil-

dren, all kinds of complicated feelings about our parents center around
as a Sign of love and approval. And that
gifts; we see the giving of a
emotional element never goes away. The recipients of gifts, financial or
otherwise, are suddenly as vulnerable as children, especially when the
comes from someone in authority. They cannot help opening up; their will
is loosened, as Louis loosened the soil.

To succeed best, the gift should come out of the blue. It should be re
like it has never been given before, or for
markable for the fact that a
being preceded by a cold shoulder from the giver. The more often you give
to particular people, the blunter this weapon becomes. If they don’t take
your gifts for granted, becoming monsters of ingratitude, they will resent
what appears to be charity. The sudden, unexpected, onetime gift will not
spoil your children; it will keep them under your thumb.

Observance V
The antique dealer Fushimiya, who lived in the city of Edo (former name
for Tokyo) in the seventeenth century, once made a stop at a village tea~
house. After enjoying a cup of tea, he spent several minutes scrutinizing the
cup, which he eventually paid for and took away with him. A local artisan,
watching this, waited until Fushimiya left the shop, then approached the old
woman who owned the teahouse and asked her who this man was. She told
him it was japan’s most famous connoisseur, antique dealer to the lord of
Izurno. The artisan ran out of the shop, caught up with Fushimiya, and
begged him to sell him the cup, which must clearly be valuable if Fushimiya
judged it so. Fushimiya laughed heartily: “It’s just an ordinary cup of Bizen
ware,” he explained, “and it is not valuable at all. The reason I was looking
at it was that the steam seemed to hang about it strangely and I wondered if
there wasn’t a leak somewhere.” (Devotees of the Tea Ceremony were in-
terested in any odd or accidental beauty in nature.) Since the artisan still
seemed so excited about it, Fushimiya gave him the cup for free.

The artisan took the cup around, trying to find an expert who would
appraise it at a high price, but since all of them recognized it as an ordinary
teacup he got nowhere. Soon he was neglecting his own business, thinking
only of the cup and the fortune it could bring. Finally he went to Edo to
talk to Fushimiya at his shop. There the dealer, realizing that he had inad~
vertently caused this man pain by making him believe the cup had great
worth, paid him 100 ryo (gold pieces) for the cup as a kindness. The cup
was indeed mediocre, but he wanted to rid the artisan of his obsession,
while also allowing him to feel that his effort had not been wasted. The ar-
tisan thanked him and went on his way.

Soon word spread of Fushimiya’s purchase of the teacup. Every dealer
injapan clamored for him to sell it, since a cup he had bought for 100 ryo
must be worth much more. He tried to explain the circumstances in which
he had bought the cup, but the dealers could not be dissuaded. Fushimiya
finally relented and put the cup up for sale.

During the auction, two buyers simultaneously bid 200 ryo for the
teacup, and then began to fight over who had bid first. Their fighting

tipped over a. table and the teacup fell to the ground and broke into several
pieces. The auction was clearly over. Fushimiya glued and mended the
cup, then stored it away, thinking the affair finished. Years later, however,
the great tea master Matsudalra Fumai visited the store, and asked to see
the cup, which by then had become legendazy. Fumai examined it. “As a
piece,” he said, “it is not up to much, but a Tea Master prizes sentiment and
association more than intrinsic value.” He bought the cup for a high sum.
A gluedtogelher work of less than ordinary craftsmanship had become
one of the most famous objects in japan.
Interpretation
The story shows, first, an essential aspect of money: That it is humans who
have created it and humans who instill it with meaning and value. Second,
with objects as with money, what the courtier most values are the semi»
ments and emotions embedded in them»-these are what make them worth
having. The lesson is simple: The more your gifts and your acts of generos-
ity play with sentiment, the more powerful they are. The object or concept
that plays with a charged emotion or hits a chord of sentiment has more
power than the money you squander on an expensive yet lifeless present.

Observance VI
Akimoto Suzutomo, a wealthy adherent of the tea ceremony, once gave his
page 100 ryo (gold pieces) and instructed him to purchase a tea bowl of-
fered by a particular dealer. When the page saw the bowl, he doubted it
was worth that much, and after much bargaining got the price reduced to
95 ryo. Days later, afler Suzutomo had put the bowl to use,
the page
proudly told him what he had done.

“What an ignoramus you are!” replied Suzutomo. “A tea. bowl that
anyone asks 100 pieces of gold for can only be a family heirloom, and a
thing like that is only sold when the family is pressed for money. And in
that case they will be hoping to find someone who will give even 150
pieces for it. So what sort of fellow is it who does not consider their feel-
ings? Quite apart from that, a curio that you give l0O ryo for is something
worth having, but one that has only cost 95 gives a mean impression. 50
never let me see that tea bowl again!” And he had the bowl locked away,
and never took it out.

Interpretation
When you insist on paying less, you may save your five ryo, but the insult
you cause and the cheap impression you create will cost you in reputation,
which is the thing the powerful prize above all. Learn to pay the full
price-—it vn&#x27;ll save you a lot in the end.

The great Lord Date Masamune happened to pass by and was induced to
parficipate. For a prize, he offered the gourd that hung from his belt. Every~
one laughed, for no one wanted to win this cheap item. A retainer of the
host finally accepted the gourd.

When the party broke up, however, and the generals were chatting
outside the tent, Masamune brought over his magnificent horse and gave it
to the retainer. “There,” he said, “a horse has come out of the gourd.” The
stunned generals suddenly regretted their scorn at Masamune’s gift.
Interpretation
Masamune understood the following: Money gives its possessor the ability
to give pleasure to others. The more you can do this, the more you attract
admiration. When you make a horse come out of a gourd, you give the ul-
timate demonstration of your power.

REVERSAL
The powerful never forget that what is offered for free is inevitably a trick.
Friends who offer favors without asking for payment will later want some
thing far dearer than the money you would have paid them. The bargain
has hidden problems, both material and psychological. Learn to pay, then,
and to pay well.

On the other hand, this Law offers great opportunities for swindling
and deception if you apply it from the other side. Dangling the lure of at
free lunch is the con artisfs stock in trade.

No man was better at this than the most successful con artist of our
age, Joseph Weil, a.k.a. “The Yellow Kid.” The Yellow Kid learned early
that what made his swindles possible was his fellow humans’ greed. “This
desire to get something for nothing,” he once wrote, “has been very costly
to many people who have dealt with me and with other can men. ,
When people lea.rn——a3 I doubt they will—that they can’t get something
for nothing, crime will diminish and we shall all live in greater harmony.”
Over the years Weil devised many ways to seduce people with the prospect
of easy money. He would hand out “free” real estate——who could resist
such an offer?——and then the suckers would learn they had to pay $25 to
register the sale. Since the land was free, it seemed worth the high fee, and
the Yellow Kid would make thousands of dollars on the phony registration.
In exchange he would give his suckers a phony deed. Other times, he
would tell suckers about a fixed horse race, or a stock that would earn 200
percent in a few weeks. As he spun his stories he would watch the sucker’s
eyes open wide at the thought of a free lunch.

.

.

The lesson is simple: Bait your deceptions with the possibility of easy
money. People are essentially lazy, and want wealth to fall in their lap
rather than to work for it. For at small sum, sell them advice on how to
make millions (P. T. Barnum did this later in life), and that small sum will
become a fortune when multiplied by thousands of suckers. Lure people in
with the prospect of easy money and you have the room to work still more
deceptions on them, since greed is powerful enough to blind your victims
to anything. And as the Yellow Kid said, half the fun is teaching a moral
lesson: Greed does not pay.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
When Louis XIV died, in 1715, after a glorious fifty—five-year reign, all eyes
focused on his great-grandson and chosen successor, the future Louis XV.
Would the boy, only five at the time, prove as great a leader as the Sun
King? Louis XIV had transforrned a country on the verge of civil war into
the preeminent power in Europe. The last years of his reign had been difli~
cult—-he had been old and l:ired——but it was hoped that the child would de-
velop into the kind of strong ruler who would reinvigorate the land and
add to the firm foundation that Louis XIV had laid.

To this end the child was given the best minds of France as his tutors,
men who would instruct him in Lhe ads of statecraft, in the methods that
the Sun King had perfected. Nothing was neglected in his education. But
when Louis XV came to the throne, in 1726, a sudden change came over
him: He no longer had to study or please others or prove himself. He stood
alone at the top of a great country, with wealth and power at his command.
He could do as he wished.

In the first years of his reign, Louis gave himself over to pleasure, leav-
ing the government in the hands of a ousted minister, André-Hercule de
Fleuiy. This caused little concern, for he was a. young man who needed to
sow his wild oats, and de Fleury was a good minister. But it slowly became
clear that {his was more than a passing phase. Louis had no interest in gov-
erning. His main worry was not France’s finances, or a possible war with
Spain, but boredom. He could not stand being bored, and when he was not

Hence. This is risky business. First, it is often difficult to foresee which side
will prevail in the long run. But even if you guess right and ally yourself
with the stronger party, you may find yourself swallowed up and lost, or
conveniently forgotten, when they become victors. Side with the weaker,
on the other hand, and you are doomed. But play a waiting game and you
cannot lose.

In Frances July Revolution of 1830, after three days of riots, the states-
man Talleyrand, now elderly, sat by his Paris window, listening to the peel-
ing bells that signaled the riots were over. Turning to an assistant, he said,
“Ah, the bells! We’re winning.” “Who’s ‘we,’ man puma?” the assistant
asked. Gesturing for the man to keep quiet, Talleyrand replied, “Not a
word! I’ll tell you who we are tomorrow.” He well knew that only fools
rush into a situalion—tl1a.t by committing too quickly you lose your ma~
neuverability. People also respect you less: Perhaps tomorrow, they think,
you will commit to another, dilferent cause, since you gave yourself so eas
ily to this one. Good fortune is a fickle god and will often pass from one
side to the other. Commitment to one side deprives you of the advantage of
time and the luxury of waiting. Let others fall in love with this group or
that; for your part don’t rush in, don’t lose your head.

Finally, there are occasions when it is wisest to drop all pretence of ap-
pearing supportive and instead to trumpet your independence and self»
reliance. The aristocratic pose of independence is particularly important
for those who need to gain respect. George Washington recognized this in
his work to establish the young American republic on firm ground As
president, Washington avoided the temptation of making an alliance with
France or England, despite the pressure on him to do so. He wanted the
country to earn the world’s respect through its independence. Although a
treaty with France mighthave helped in the short toxin, in the long run he
knew it would be more effective to establish the nation’s autonomy. Eu-
rope would have to see the United States as an equal power.

Remember: You have only so much energy and so much time. Every
moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength. You
may be afraid that people will condemn you as heartless, but in the end,
maintaining your independence and selfvreliance will gain you more re
spect and place you in a position of power from which you can choose to
help others on your own initiative.

Both parts of this law will turn against you if you take it too far. The game
proposed here is delicate and difficult. If you play too many parties against
one another, they will see through the maneuver and will gang up on you.
If you keep your growing number of suitors waiting too long, you will in-
spire not desire but distrust. People will start to lose interest. Eventually
you may find it worthwhile to commit to one sidevwif only for appearances’
sake, to prove you are capable of attachment.

Even then, however, the key will be to maintain your inner indepen-
dence-—to keep yourself from getting emotionally involved. Preserve the
unspoken option of being able to leave at any moment and reclaim your
freedom if the side you are allied with starts to collapse. The friends you
made while you were being courted will give you plenty of places to go

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the winter of 1872, the U.S. financier Asbury Harpending; was visiting
London when he received a cable: A diamond mine had been discovered

in the American West. The cable came from a reliable source—-William
Ralston, owner of the Bank of Califomia—-but Harpending nevertheless
took it as a practical joke, probably inspired by the recent discovery of
huge diamond mines in South Africa. True, when reports had first come in
of gold being discovered in the western United States, everyone had been
skeptical, and those had turned out to be true. But a diamond mine in the
West‘ Haipending showed the cable to his fellow financier Baron Roth
schild (one of the richest men in the world), saying it must be a joke. The
baron, however, replied, “Don’t be too sure about that. America is a very
large country. It has furnished the world with many surprises already. Per-
haps it has others in store.” Harpending promptly took the first ship back
to the States.

When Harpending reached San Francisco, there was an excitement in
the air recalling the Gold Rush days of the late 1840s. Two crusty prospec-
tors named Philip Arnold and john Slack had been the ones to find the di-
amond mine. They had not divulged its location, in Wyoming, but had led
. aliighly respected mining expert to it several weeks back, taking a circular
route so he could not guess his whereabouts. Once there, the expert had
watched as the miners dug up diamonds. Back in San Francisco the expert
had taken the gems to various jewelers, one of whom had estimated their
worth at $15 million.

Ha:-pending and Ralston now asked Amold and Slack to accompany
them back to New York, where the jeweler Charles Tiffany would verify
the original estimates. The prospectors responded uneasily--they smelled
a trap: How could they must these city slickers? Vifhat if Tiffany and the fi-
nanciers managed to steal the whole mine out from under them? Ralston
tried to allay their fears by giving them $100,000 and placing another
$300,000 in escrow for them. If the deal went through, they would be paid
an additional $300,000. The miners agreed.

The little group traveled to New York, where a meeting was held at the
mansion of Samuel L. Barlow. The cream of the city’s aristocracy was in at-
tx-,ndance——General George Brinton McClellan, commander of the Union
forces in the Civil War; General Benjamin Butler; Horace Greeley, editor
of the newspaper the New Ybrk Tribune; Harpending; Ralston; and Tiffany.
Only Slack and Arnold were missing—-as tourists in the city, they had de-
cided to go sight-seeing.

_,

When Tiffany announced that the gems were real and worth a. fortune,
the financiers could barely control their excitement. They wired Roth-
schild and other tycoons to tell them about the diamond mine and inviting
they also told the
them to share in the investment. At the same time,
prospectors that they wanted one more test: They insisted that a mining ex-
I pert of their choosing accompany Slack and Arnold to the site to verify its
&#x27; wealth. The prospectors reluctantly agreed. In the meantime, they said,

they had to return to San Francisco. The jewels that Tiffany had examined
they left with Harpending for safekeeping.

Several weeks later, a man named Louis Janin, the best mining expert
in the country, met the prospectors in San Francisco. _]ani.n was a born
skeptic who was determined to make sure that the mine was not a fraud.
Accompanying janin were Harpending, and several other interested fi~
nanciers. As with the previous expert, the prospectors led the team through
a complex series of canyons, completely confusing them as to their where
abouts. Arriving at the site, the financiers watched in amazement as janin
dug the area up, leveling anthills, turning over boulders, and finding emer-
alds, rubies, sapphires, and most of all diamonds. The dig lasted eight days,
was convinced: He told the investors that they now
and by the end,
possessed the richest field in mining history. “With a hundred men and
proper machinery,&quot; he told them, “I would guarantee to send out one mil
lion dollars in diamonds every thirty days.&quot;

Returning to San Francisco a few days later, Ralston, Harpending, and
company acted fast to form a $10 million corporation of private investors.
First, however, they had to get rid of Arnold and Slack. That meant hiding
their excitement—they certainly did not want to reveal the field’s real
value. So they played possum. Who knows if _]anin is right, they told the
prospectors, the mine may not be as rich as we think. This just made the
prospectors angry. Trying a different tactic, the financiers told the two men
that if they insisted on having shares in the mine, they would end up being
fleeced by the unscrupulous tycoons and investors who would run the cor-
poration; better, they said, to take the $700,000 already offerecl—an enor»
mous sum at the time—and put their greed aside. This the prospectors
seemed to understand, and they finally agreed to take the money, in return
signing the rights to the site over to the financiers, and leaving maps to it.

News of the mine spread like wildfire. Prospectors fanned out across
Wyoming. Meanwhile Harpending and group began spending the millions
they had collected from their investors, buying equipment, hiring the best
men in the business, and furnishing luxurious offices in New York and San
Francisco.

0

A few weeks later, on their first trip back to the site, they learned the
hard truth: Not a single diamond or ruby was to be found. It was all a fake.
They were mined. Harpending had unwittingly lured the richest men in
the world into the biggest scam of the century.

Interpretation
Arnold and Slack pulled off their stupendous con not by using a fake engi-
neer or bribing Tiffany: All of the experts had been real. All of them hon-
estly believed in the existence of the mine and in the value of the gems.
What had fooled them all was nothing else than Arnold and Slack them-
selves. The two men seemed to be such rubes, such hayseeds, so naive, that
no one for an instant had believed them capable of an audacious scam.
The prospectors had simply observed the law of appearing more stupid
than the mark-—the deceiver’s First Commandment.

The logistics of the con were quite simple. Months before Arnold and
Slack announced the “discovery” of the diamond mine, they traveled to
Europe, where they purchased some real gems for around $12,000 (part of
the money they had saved from their days as gold miners). They then
salted the “mine” with these gems, which the first expert dug up and
brought to San Francisco. The jewelers who had appraised these stones, in»
cluding Tiffany himself, had gotten caught up in the fever and had grossly
overestimated their value. Then Ralston gave the prospectors $l00,000 as
security, and immediately after their trip to New York they simply went to
Amsterdam, where they bought sacks of uncut gems, before ramming to
San Francisco. The second time they salted the mine, there were many
more jewels to be found.

The effectiveness of the scheme, however, rested not on tricks like
these but on the fact that Arnold and Slack played their parts to perfection.
On their trip to New York, where they mingled with millionaires and ty—
coons, they played up their clodhopper image, wearing pants and coats a
size or two too small and acting incredulous at everything they saw in the
big city. No one believed that these country simpletons could possibly be
conning the most devious, unscrupulous financiers of the time. And once
Harpending, Ralston, and even Rothschild accepted the mine’s existence,
anyone who doubted it was questioning the intelligence of the world’s most
successful businessmen.

In the end, Harpending’s reputation was mined and he never recov-
ered; Rothschild learned his lesson and never fell for another con; Slack
took his money and disappeared from view, never to be found. Arnold
simply went home to Kentucky. After all, his sale of his mining rights had
been legitimate; the buyers had taken the best advice, and if the mine had
run out of diamonds, that was their problem. Arnold used the money to
greatly enlarge his farm and open up a bank of his own.

KEYS TO POWER
The feeling that someone else is more intelligent than we are is almost in-
tolerable. We usually try to justify it in difierent ways: “He only has book
knowledge, whereas I have real knowledge.” “Her parents paid for her to
get a good education. If my parents had had as much money, if I had been
. .” “He’s not as smart as he thinks.” Last but not least: “She
as privileged. .
may know her narrow little field better than I do, but beyond that she’s re-
ally not smart at all. Even Einstein was a boob outside physics.”

Given how important the idea of intelligence is to most people’s van-
ity, it is critical never inadvertently to insult or impugn a person’s brain
power. That is an unforgivable sin. But if you can make this iron rule work
for you, it opens up all sorts of avenues of deception. Sublirninally reassure
people that they are more intelligent than you are, or even that you are a
bit of a moron, and you can run rings around them. The feeling of intellee
tual superiority you give them will disarm their suspiciorrmuscles.

In 1865 the Prussian councillor Otto von Bismarck wanted Austria to

LAW 21

I59

;

sign a certain treaty. The treaty was totally in the interests of Prussia and
against the interests of Austria, and Bismarck would have to strategize to
get the Ausmans to agree to it But the Austrian negotiator, Count Blorne,
was an avid cardplayer. His particular game was quinze, and he often said
that he could judge a man’s character by the way he played quinze. Bis-
marck knew of this saying of Blome’s.

The night before the negotiations were to begin, Bismarck innocently
engaged Blome in a game of quinze. The Prussian would later write, “That
was the very last time I ever played quinze. I played so recklessly that
everyone was astonished. I lost several thousand talers [the currency of the
time], but I succeeded in fooling [Blome], for he believed me to be more
venturesome than I am and I gave way.” Besides appearing reckless, Bis-
marck also played the witless fool, saying ridiculous things and bumbling
about with a surplus of nervous energy.

All this made Blome feel he had gadiered valuable information. He
knew that Bismarck was aggressive———the Prussian already had that reputa-
tion, and the way he played had confirmed it. And aggressive men, Blome
knew, can be foolish and rash. Accordingly, when the time came to Sign
the treaty, Blome thought he had the advantage. A heedless fool like Bis-
marck, he thought, is incapable of cold—blooded calculation and deception,
so he only glanced at the treaty before signing it—he failed to read the fine
print. As soon as the ink was dry, a joyous Bismarck exclaimed in his face,
“Well, I could never have believed that I should find an Austrian diplomat
willing to sign that document!”

The Chinese have a phrase, “Masqueracling as a swine to kill
the
tiger.” This refers to an ancient hunting technique in which the hunter
clothes himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting. The
mighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get close, savoring
the prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the last laugh.

Masquerading as a swine works wonders on those who, like tigers, are
arrogant and overconfident: The easier they think it is to prey on you, the
more easily you can turn the tables. This trick is also useful if you are ambi-
tious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy: Appearing less intelligent than
you are, even a bit of a fool, is the perfect disguise. Look like a harmless pig
and no one will believe you harbor dangerous ambitions. They may even
promote you since you seem so likable, and subservient. Claudius before
he became emperor of Rome, and the prince of France who later became
Louis XIII, used this tactic when those above them suspected they might
have designs on the throne. By playing the fool as young men, they were
left alone. When the time came for them to strike, and to act with vigor and
decisiveness, they caught everyone oi?-guard.

Intelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop there?
Taste and sophistication rank close to intelligence on the vanity scale;
make people feel they are more sophisticated than you are and their guard
will come down. As Arnold and Slack knew, an air of complete naiveté can
work wonders. Those fancy financiers were laughing at them behind their

I60 3

LAW 2]

backs, but who laughed loudest in the end? In general, then, always make
people believe they are smarter and more sophisticated than you are. They
will keep you around because you make them feel better about themselves,
and the longer you are around, the more opportunities you will have to do
ceive them.

The Opossum. In playing

Many a predator has therefore left it

ugly, unintelligent, nervous little creature
could be capable of such deception?

Authority: Know how to make use of stupidity: The wisest man
plays this card at times. There are occasions when the highest
wisdom consists in appearing not to know—you must not be ign0—
rant but capable of playing it. It is not much good being wise
among fools and sane among lunatics. He who poses as a fool is not
a fool. The best way to be well received by all is to clothe yourself
in the skin of the dumbest of brutes. (Baltasar Gracién, 1601-1658)

REVE RS A14
To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in
the habit of downplaying it at all times. If people inadvertently learn the
truth—-that you are actually much smarter than you look--«they will admire
you more for being discreet than for making your brilliance show. At the
start of your climb to the top, of course, you cannot play too stupid: You
may want to let your bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter
than the competition around you. As you climb the ladder, however, you
should to some degree try to dampen your brilliance.

There is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite-
when you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In matters
of smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you seem to
have authority and knowledge, people will believe what you say. This can
be very useful in getting you out of a scrape.

The art dealer Joseph Duveen was once attending a soirée at the New
York home of a tycoon to whom he had recently sold a Diirer painting for

LAW 21

I51

a high price. Among the guests was a young French art critic who seemed
extremely knowledgeable and confident. Wanting to impress this man, the
tyeoon’s daughter showed him the Diirer, which had not yet been hung.
The critic studied it for a time, then finally said, “You know, I don’t think
this Diirer is right.” He followed the young woman as she hurried to tell
her father what he had said, and listened as the magnate, deeply unsettled,
turned to Duveen for reassurance. Duveen just laughed. “How very amus-
ing,” he said. “Do you realize, young man, that at least twenty other art ex-
perts here and in Europe have been taken in too, and have said that
painting isn’t genuine? And now you’ve made the same mistake.” His con-
fident tone and air of authority intimidated the Frenchman, who apolo-
gized for his mistake.

Duveen knew that the art market was flooded with fakes, and that
many paintings had been falsely ascribed to old masters. He tried his best
to distinguish the real from the fake, but in his zeal to sell he often over-
played a work’s authenticity. What mattered to him was that the buyer be-
lieved he had bought a Diii-er, and that Duveen himself convinced
everyone of his “expertness” through his air of irreproachable authority,
Thus, it is important to be able to play the professor when necessary and
never impose such an attitude for its own sake.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
The island of Melos is strategically situated in the heart of the Mediter-
ranean. In classical times, the city of Athens dominated the sea and coastal
areas around Greece, but Sparta, in the Peloponnese, had been Mel0s’s
original colonizer. During the Peloponnesian War, then, the Melians re-
fused to ally themselves with Athens and remained loyal to Mother Sparta.
In 416 B.C. the Athenians sent an expedition against Melos, Before launch-
ing an all—out attack, however, they dispatched a delegation to persuade the
Melians to surrender and become an ally rather than suffer devastation and
defeat.

“You know as well as we do,” the delegates said, “that the standard of
justice depends on the equality of power to compel, and that in fact the
strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they
have to accept.” When the Melians responded that this denied the notion
of fair play, the Athenians said that those in power determined what was
fair and what was not. The Melians argued that this authority belonged to
the gods, not to mortals, “Our opinion of the gods and our knowledge of
men,” replied a member of the Athenian delegation, “lead us to conclude
that it is a general and necessary law of nature to rule whatever one can.”

The Melians would not budge. Sparta, they insisted, would come to
their defense. The Athenians countered that the Spartans were a conserva-
tive, practical people, and would not help Melos because they had nothing
to gain and a lot to lose by doing so.

Finally the Melians began to talk of honor and the principle of resisting
brute force. “Do not be led astray by a false sense of honor,” said the Athe-
nians. “Honor often brings men to ruin when they are faced with an obvi-
ous danger that somehow affects their pride. There is nothing disgraceful in
giving way to the greatest city in Hellas when she is offering you such rea-
sonable terms.” The debate ended. The Melians discussed the issue among
themselves, and decided to trust in the aid of the Spartans, the will of the
gods, and the tightness of their cause. They politely declined the Athenians’
offer.

A few days later the Athenians invaded Melos. The Melians fought
nobly, even without the Spartans, who did not come to their rescue. It took
several attempts before the Athenians could surround and besiege their
main city, but the Melians finally surrendered. The Athenians wasted no
tirne—they put to death all the men of military age that they could capture,
they sold the women and children as slaves, and they re.-populated the is
land with their own colonists. Only a handful of Melians survived.

Interpretation
The Athenians were one of the most eminently practical people in history,
and they made the most practical argument they could with the Melians:
When you are weaker, there is nothing to be gained by fighting a useless
fight. No one comes to help the weak—by doing so they would only put
themselves in jeopardy. The weak are alone and must submit. Fighting

Weakness is no sin, and can even become a strength if you learn how
to play it right. Had the Melians surrendered in the first place, they would
have been able to sabotage the Athenians in subtle ways, or might have
gotten what they could have out of the alliance and then left it when the
Athenians themselves were weakened, as in fact happened several years
later. Fortunes change and the mighty are often brought down. Surrender
conceals great power: Lulling the enemy into complacency, it gives you
time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge. Never sacrifice that
time in exchange for honor in a battle that you cannot win.

Weak people never give way when they ought to.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW

Sometime in the 19205 the German writer Bertolt Brecht became a convert
to the cause of Communism. From then on his plays, essays, and poems re-
flected his revolutionary fervor, and he generally tried to make his ideolog-
ical statements as clear as possible. When Hitler came to power in
Germany, Brecht and his Communist colleagues became marked men. He
had many friends in the United States—Amerlcans who sympathized with
his beliefs, as well as fellow German intellectuals who had lied Hitler. In
1941, accordingly, Brecht emigrated to the United States, and chose to set-
tle in Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a living in the film business.

Over the next few years Brecht wrote screenplays with a pointedly an—
ticapitalist slant. He had little success in Hollywood, so in 1947, the war
having ended, he decided to return to Europe. That same year, however,
the US. Cong;ress’s House Un—American Activities Committee began its
investigation into supposed Communist infiltration in Hollywood. It began
to gather information on Brecht, who had so openly espoused Marxism,
and on September 19, 1947, only a month before he had planned to leave
the United States, he received a subpoena to appear before the committee.
In addition to Brecht, a number of other writers, producers, and directors
were summoned to appear as well, and this group came to be known as the
Hollywood 19.

Before going to Washington, the Hollywood 19 met to decide on a plan
of action. Their approach would be confrontational. Instead of answering
questions about their membership, or lack of it, in the Communist Party,
they would read prepared statements that would challenge the authority of
the committee and argue that its activities were unconstitutional. Even if
this strategy meant imprisonment, it would gain publicity for their cause.

Brecht disagreed. What good was it, he asked, to play the martyr and
gain a little public sympathy if in the process they lost the ability to stage
their plays and sell their scripts for years to come? He felt certain they were

all more intelligent than the members of the committee. Why lower them-
selves to the level of their opponents by arguing with them? Why not out
fox the committee by appearing to surrender to it while subtly mocking it?
The Hollywood 19 listened to Brecht politely, but decided to stick to their
plan, leaving Brecht to go his own way.

The committee finally summoned Brecht on October 30. They ex-
pected him to do what others among the Hollywood 19 who had testified
before him had done: Argue, refuse to answer questions, challenge the
committee&#x27;s right to hold its hearing, even yell and hurl insults. Much to
their surprise, however, Brecht was the very picture of Congeniality. He
wore a suit (something he rarely did), smoked a cigar (he had heard that
the committee chairman was a passionate cigar smoker), answered their
questions politely, and generally deferred to their authority.

Unlike the other witnesses, Brecht answered the question of whether
he belonged to the Communist Party: He was not a member, he said,
which happened to be the truth. One committee member asked him, “is it
true you have written a number of revolutionary plays?” Brecht had writ-
ten many plays with overt Communist messages, but he responded, “I
have written a number of poems and songs and plays in the fight against
Hitler and, of course, they can be considered, therefore, as revolutionary
because I, of course, was for the overthrow of that government.” This state
ment went unchallenged.

Brecht’s English was more than adequate, but he used an interpreter
throughout his testimony, a tactic that allowed him to play subtle games
with language. When committee members found Communist leanings in
lines from English editions of his poems, he would repeat the lines in Ger
man for the interpreter, who would then retranslate them; and somehow
they would come out innocuous. At one point a committee member read
one of Brechfs revolutionary poems out loud in English, and asked him if
he had written it. “No,” he responded, “I wrote a German poem, which is
very different from this.” The author&#x27;s elusive answers baffled the commit-
tee members, but his politeness and the way he yielded to their authority
made it impossible for them to get angry with him.

After only an hour of questioning, the committee members had had
enough. “Thank you very much,” said the chairman, “You are a good ex-
ample to the {other} witnesses.” Not only did they free him, they offered to
help him if he had any trouble with immigration oficials who might detain
him for their own reasons. The following day, Brecht left the United States,
never to return.

Interpretation
The Hollywood 19’s confrontational approach won them a lot of sympa~
thy, and years later they gained a kind of vindication in public opinion. But
they were also blacklisted, and lost valuable years of profitable working
time. Brecht, on the other hand, expressed his disgust at the committee
more indirectly. It was not that he changed his beliefs or compromised his
values; instead, during his short testimony, he kept the upper hand by ap-

166

LAW 22

pearing to yield while all the time running circles around the committee
with vague responses, outright lies that went unchallenged because they
were wrapped in enigmas, and word games. In the end he kept the free-
dom to continue his revolutionary writing (as opposed to suffering impris
onment or detainment in the United States), even while subtly mocking the
committee and its authority with his pseudo-obedience.

Keep in mind the following: People trying to make a show of their au-
thority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic. Your outward sign of
submission makes them feel
important; satisfied that you respect them,
they become easier targets for a later counterattack, or for the kind of indi»
rect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your power over time, never sacri-
fice long-term maneuverability for the short-lived glories of martyrdom.

KEYS T0 POWER
What gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own overreac~
tion to the moves of our enemies and rivals. That overreaction creates
problems we would have avoided had we been more reasonable. It also
has an endless rebound effect, for the enemy then overreacts as well, much
as the Athenians did to the Melians. It is always our first instinct to react, to
meet aggression with some other kind of aggression. But the next time
someone pushes you and you find yourself starting to react, try this: Do not
resist or fight back, but yield, turn the other cheek, bend. You will find that
this often neutralizes their behavior——they expected, even wanted you to
react with force and so they are caught ofiguard and confounded by your
lack of resistance. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because
your surrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have
defeated you.

This is the essence of the surrender tactic: Inwardly you stay firm, but
outwardly you bend. Deprived of a reason to get angry, your opponents
will often be bewildered instead. And they are unlikely to react with more
violence, which would demand a reaction from you. Instead you are al
lowed the time and space to plot the countermoves that will bring them
down. In the battle of the intelligent against the brutal and the aggressive,
the surrender tactic is the supreme weapon. It does require self~control:
Those who genuinely surrender give up their freedom, and may be
crushed by the humiliation of their defeat You have to remember that you
only appear to surrender, like the animal that plays dead to save its hide.

We have seen that it can be better to surrender than to fight; faced with
a. more powerful opponent and a sure defeat, it is often also better to sur-
render than to run away. Running away may save you for the time being,
but the aggressor will eventually catch up with you.
you surrender in-
stead, you have an opportunity to coil around your enemy and strike with
your fangs from close up.

In 473 B.C., in ancient China, King Goujian of Yue suffered a horrible
defeat from the ruler of Wu in the battle of Fujiao. Goujian wanted to flee,
but he had an adviser who told him to surrender and to place himself in the
service of the ruler of Wu, from which position he could study the man and
plot his revenge. Deciding to follow this advice, Goujian gave the ruler all
of his riches, and went to work in his conqueror’s stables as the lowest ser-
vant. For three years he humbled himself before the ruler, who then, finally
satisfied of his loyalty, allowed him to return home. Inwardly, however,
Goujian had spent those three years gathering information and plotting re-
venge. When a terrible drought struck Wu, and the kingdom was weak
ened by irmer turmoil, he raised an army, invaded, and won with ease.
That is the power behind surrender: It gives you the time and the flexibility
to plot a devastating counterblow. Had Goujian run away, he would have
lost this chance.

When foreign trade began to threaten Japanese independence in the
mid—nineteenth century, the Japanese debated how to defeat the foreign-
ers. One minister, Hotta Masayoshi, wrote a memorandum in 1857 that in-
fluenced Japanese policy for years to come: “I am therefore convinced that
our policy should be to conclude friendly alliances, to send ships to foreign
counhies everywhere and conduct trade, to copy the foreigners where they
are at their best and so repair our own shortcomings, to foster our national
strength and complete our armaments, and so gradually subject the foreigrr
ers to our influence until in the end all the countries of the world know the
tranquillity and our hegemony is acknowledged
blessings of perfect
throughout the globe.” This is a brilliant application of the Law: Use sur-
render to gain access to your enemy. Learn his ways, insinuate yourself
with him slowly, outwardly conform to his customs, but inwardly maintain
your own culture. Eventually you will emerge victorious, for while he con—
siders you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions against you, you are
using the time to catch up and surpass him. This soft, penneable form of in»
vasion is often the best, for the enemy has nothing to react against, prepare
for, or resist. And had japan resisted Western influence by force, it might
well have suffered a devastating invasion that would have permanently al-
tered its culture.

Surrender can also offer a way of mocking your enemies, of turning
their power against them, as it did for Brecht. Milan Kundera’s novel 7719
Jake, based on the author’s experiences in a penal camp in Czechoslovakia,
tells the story of how the prison guards organized a relay race, guards
against prisoners. For the guards this was a chance to show off their physi-
cal superiority. The prisoners knew they were expected to lose, so they
went out of their way to oblige-—miming exaggerated exertion while
barely moving, running a few yards and collapsing, limping, jogging ever
so slowly while the guards raced ahead at full speed. Both by joining the
race and by losing ig they had obliged the guards obediently; but their
“overobedience” had mocked the event to the point of mining it. Overobe-
dience—su.rrender—was here a way to demonstrate superiority in a re-
verse manner. Resistance would have engaged the prisoners in the cycle of

I65

LAW 22

violence, lowering them to the guards’ level. Overobeying the guards, how»
ever, made them ridiculous, yet they could not rightly punish the prison»
ers, who had only done what they asked.

Power is always in flux—since the game is by nature fluid, and an arena
of constant struggle, those with power almost always find themselves even-
tually on the downward swing. If you find yourself temporarily weakened,
the surrender tactic is perfect for raising yourselfup again»-it disguises your
ambition; it teaches you patience and self—control, key skills in the game;
and it puts you in the best possible position for taking advantage of your up-
pressofs sudden slide. If you run away or fight back, in the long run you
cannot win. If you surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious.

The point of surrendering is to save your hide for a later date when you
can reassert yourself. It is precisely to avoid martyrdom that one surren-
ders, but there are times when the enemy will not relent, and martyrdom
seems the only way out Furthermore, if you are willing to die, others may
gain power and inspiration from your example.

Yet martyrdom, surrender’s reversal, is a. messy, inexact tactic, and is
as violent as the aggression it combats. For every famous martyr there are
thousands more who have inspired neither a religion nor a rebellion, so
that if martyrdom does sometimes grant a certain power, it does so unpre-
dictably. More important, you will not be around to enjoy that power, such
as it is. And there is finally something selfish and arrogant about martyrs,
as if they felt their followers were less important than their own glory,

When power deserts you, it is best to ignore this Law’s reversal. Leave
martyrdom alone: The pendulum will swing back your way eventually,
and you should stay alive to see it.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In China in the early sixth century B.C., the kingdom of Wu began a was
with the neighboring norlhem provinces of the Middle Kingdom. Wu was
a. growing power, but it lacked the great history and civilization of the Mid
dle Kingdom, for centuries the center of Chinese culture. By defeating the
Middle Kingdom, the king of Wu would instantly raise his status.

The war began with great fanfare and several victories, but it soon
bogged down. A victory on one from would leave the Wu armies vulnera~
ble on another. The king’ s chief minister and adviser, Wu Tzu-hsiu, warned
him that the barbarous state of Yueh, to the south, was beginning to notice
the kingdom of V\’u’s problems and had designs to invade. The king only
laughed at such w0rries~one more big victory and the great Middle King—
dom would be his.

In the year 490, Wu T212-hsiu sent his son away to safety in the king-
dom of Ch’i. In doing so he sent the king a signal that he disapproved of
the war, and that he believed the king’s selfish ambition was leading Wu to
min. The king, sensing betrayal, lashed out at his minister, accusing him of
a lack of loyalty and, in a fit of anger, ordered him to kill himself. Wu Tzu-
hsiu obeyed his king, but before he plunged the knife into his chest, he
cried, “Tear out my eyes, oh King, and fix them on the gate of Wu, so that I
may see the triumphant entry of Yueh.”

As Wu Tzwlrsiu had predicted, within a few years a Yueh army passed
beneath the gate of Wu. As the barbarians surrounded the palace, the king
remembered his minister’s last Words-——~and felt the dead man’s disembod-
ied eyes watching his disgrace. Unable to hear his shame, the king killed
himself, “covering his face so that he would not have to meet the reproaclr
ful gaze of his minister in the next world.”

Interpretation
The story of Wu is a paradigm of all the empires that have come to min by
overreachlng. Drunk with success and sick with ambition, such empires ex‘
pand to grotesque proportions and meet a min that is total. This is what
happened to ancient Athens, which lusted for the faraway island of Sicily
and ended up losing its empire. The Romans stretched the boundaries of
their empire to encompass vast territories; in doing so they increased their
vulnerability, and the chances of invasion from yet another barbarian tribe.
Their useless expansion led their empire into oblivion.

For the Chinese, the fate of the kingdom of Wu serves as an elemental
lesson on what happens when you dissipate your forces on several fronts,
losing sight of distant dangers for the sake of present gain. “If you are not in
danger,” says Sun-tzu, “do not fight.” It is almost a physical law: What is
bloated beyond its proportions inevitably collapses. The mind must not
wander from goal to goal, or be distracted by success from its sense of pur-
pose and proportion. What is concentrated, coherent, and connected to its
past has power. What is dissipated, divided, and distended rots and falls to
the ground. The bigger it bloats, the harder it falls.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW’
The Rothschild banking family had humble beginnings in the Jewish
ghetto of Frankfurt, Germany. The city‘s harsh laws made it impossible for
Jews to mingle outside the ghetto, but the Jews had turned this into a
virtuemit made them self—reliant, and zealous to preserve their culture at
all costs. Mayer Amschel, the first of the Rothschilds to accumulate wealth
in the late eighteenth century, well understood the
by lending money,
power that comes from this kind of concentration and cohesion.

First, Mayer Amschel allied himself with one family, the powerful
princes of Thom und Taxis. Instead of spreading his services out, he made
himself these princes’ primary banker. Second, he entrusted none of his
business to outsiders, using only his children and close relatives. The more
unified and tight-knit the family, the more powerful it would become. Soon
Mayer Amschel’s five sons were running the business. And when Mayer
Amschel lay dying, in 1812, he refused to name a principal heir, instead set-
ting up all of his sons to continue-the fa.mily&#x27; tradition, so that they would
stay united and would resist the dangers of dillusion and of infiltration by
outsiders.

Once Mayer Amschel’s sons controlled the family business, they de-
cided that the key to wealth on a. larger scale was to secure a foothold in the
finances of Europe as a whole, rather than being tied to any one country or
prince. Of the five brothers, Nathan had already opened up shop in Lon-
don. In 1813 James moved to Paris. Amschel remained in Frankfurt,
Salomon established himself in Vienna, and Karl, the youngest son, went
to Naples. With each sphere of influence covered, they could tighten their
hold on Europe’s financial markets.

This widespread network, of course, opened the Rothschilds to the
very danger of which their father had warned them: diliusion, division, dis-
sension. They avoided this danger, and established themselves as the most
powerful force in European finance and politics, by once again resorting to
the strategy of the ghetto-——excluding outsiders, concentrating their forces.
The Rothschiids established the fastest courier system in Europe, allowing
them to get news of events before all their competitors. They held a virtual
monopoly on information. And their internal communications and corre-
spondence were written in Frankfurt Yiddish, and in a code that only the
brothers could decipher. There was no point in stealing this information—-
no one could understand it. “Even the shewdest bankers cannot find their
way through the Rothschild maze,” admitted a financier who had tried to
infiltrate the clan.

In 1824 James Rothschild decided it was time to get married. This pre-
sented a problem for the Rothschilds, since it meant incorporating an out-
sider into the Rothschild clan, an outsider who could betray its secrets.
jarnes therefore decided to marry within the family, and chose the daugh-
ter of his brother Salomon. The brothers were ecstatic—~this was the per-
fect solution to their marriage problems. james‘s choice now became the
family policy: Two years later, Nathan married off his daughter

matches among their cluldren, sixteen of these being contracted between
first cousins.

“We are like the mechanism of a watch: Each part is essential,” said
brother Salomon. As in a watch, every part of the business moved in con-
cert with every other, and the inner workings were invisible to the world,
which only saw the movement of the hands. While other rich and powerful
families suffered irrecoverable downturns during the tumultons first half of
the nineteenth century, the tight-knit Rothschilds managed not only to pre-
serve but to expand their unprecedented wealth.

The Rothschilds were born in strange times. They came from a place that
had not changed in centuries, but lived in an age that gave birth to the In-
dustrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and an endless series of up-
resisted the patterns of
heavals. The Rothchilds kept
dispersion of their era and for this are emblematic of the law of concentra-
tion.

No one represents this better than _]ames Rothschild, the son who es-

Napoleon, the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, the bourgeois monar-
chy of Orleans, the return to a republic, and finally the enthronement of
Napoleo 1 III. French styles and fashions changed at a relentless pace dur-
ing all this turmoil. Without appearing to be a relic of the past, James
steered his family as if the ghetto lived on within them. He kept alive his
clan’s inner cohesion and strength. Only through such an anchoring in the
past was the family able to thrive amidst such chaos. Concentration was the
foundation of the Rothschilds’ power, wealth, and stability.

KEYS TO POWER
The world is plagued by greater and geater division-——within countries,
political groups, families, even individuals. We are all in a state of total dis-
traction and diffusion, hardly able to keep our minds in one direction be-
fore we are pulled in a thousand others. The modern world’s level of
conflict is higher than ever, and we have internalized it in our own lives.

The solution is a form of retreat inside ourselves, to the past, to more
concentrated forms of thought and action. As Schopenhauer wrote, “Intel-
lect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity.” Napoleon
knew the value of concentrating your forces at the enemy’s weakest spot——

Ir-4

‘ LAW 23

it was the secret of his success on the battlefield. But his willpower and his
mind were equally modeled on this notion. Single-mindedness of purpose,
total concentration on the goal, and the use of these qualifies against peo
ple less focused, people in a state of distraction—such an arrow will find its
mark every time and overwhelm the enemy.

Casanova attributed his success in life to his ability to concentrate on a
single goal and push at it until it yielded. It was his ability to give himself
over completely to the women he desired that made him so intensely se-
ducfive. For the weeks or months that one of these women lived in his
orbit, he thought of no one else. When he was imprisoned in the treacher-
ous “leads” of the doge’s palace in Venice, a prison from which no one had
ever escaped, he concentrated his mind on the single goal of escape, day
after day. A change of cells, which meant that months of digging had all
been for naught, did not discourage him; he persisted and eventually es-
caped. “I have always believed,” he later wrote, “that when a man gets it
into his head to do something, and when he exclusively occupies himself in
that design, he must succeed, whatever the diliiculties. That man will be-
come Grand Vizier or Pope.”

Concentrate C 1 a single goal, a single task, and beat it into submission.
In the world of power you will constantly need help from other people,
usually those more powerful than you. The fool flits from one person to an-
other, believing that he will survive by spreading himself out. It is a corol-
lary of the law of concentration, however, that much energy is saved, and
more power is attained, by affixing yourself to a single, appropriate source
of power. The scientist Nikola Tesla. mined himself by believing that he
somehow maintained his independence by not having to serve a single
master. He even turned down
P. Morgan, who offered him a rich con-
tract. In the end, Tesla’s “independence” meant that he could depend on
no single patron, but was always having to toady up to a dozen of them.
Later in his life he realized his mistake.

All the great Renaissance painters and writers wrestled with this prob-
lem, none more so than the sixteenth-century writer Pietro Aretino.
Throughout his life Aretino suffered the indignities of having to please this
prince and that. At last, he had had enough, and decided to woo Charles
V, promising the emperor the services of his powerful pen. He finally dis-
covered the freedom that came from attachment to a single source of
power. Michelangelo found this freedom with Pope Julius II, Galileo with
the Medicis. In the end, the singie patron appreciates your loyalty and be-
comes dependent on your services; in the long run the master serves the
slave.

Finally, power itself always exists in concentrated forms. In any orga-
nization it is inevitable for a small youp to hold the strings. And often it is
not those with the titles. In the game of power, only the fool llails about
without fixing his target. You must find out who controls the operations,
who is the real director behind the scenes. As Richelieu discovered at the
beginning of his rise to the top of the French political scene during the

LAW 23

I 75

early seventeenth century, it was not King Louis XIII who decided things,
it was the king’s mother. And so he attached himself to her, and catapulted
through the ranks of the courtiers, all the way to the top.

It is enough to strike oil once—your wealth and power are assured for

a lifetime.

Image: The Arrow. You cannot hit two targets
with one arrow. If your thoughts stray, you
miss the enemy’s heart. Mind and
arrow must become one. Only
with such concentration of
mental and physical
power can your arrow
hit the target and
pierce the
h e a r t.

Authority: Prize intensity more than extensity. Perfection re»
sides in quality, not quantity. Extent alone never rises above
mediocrity, and it is the misfortune of men with wide general
interests that while they would like to have their finger in every
pie, they have one in none. Intensity gives eminence, and rises
to the heroic in matters sublime. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

REVERSAI.
There are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion is the
proper tactical move. Fighting the Nationalists for control of China, Mao
Tse~tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on several fronts,
using sabotage and ambush as their main weapons. Dispersal is often suit-
able for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a crucial principle of guerrilla warfare.
When fighting a stronger army, concentrating your forces only makes you
an easier ta.rget—better to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate your
enemy with the elusiveness of your presence.

Tying yourself to a single source of power has one preeminent danger:
If that person dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suffer. This is what hap-
pened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his father, Pope
Alexander VI. It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to fight with and
wars to wage in his name. When he suddenly died (perhaps from poison),

I 76

LAW 23

Cesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies over the
years, and was now without his father’s protection. In cases when you may
need protection, then, it is ofien wise to entwine yourself around several
sources of power. Such a move would be especially prudent in periods of
great tumult and violent change, or when your enemies are numerous. The
more patrons and masters you serve the less risk you run if one of them
falls from power. Such dispersion will even allow you to play one off
against the other. Even if you concentrate on the single source of power,
you still must practice caution, and 1 cepare for the day when your master
or patron is no longer there to help you.

Finally, being too singlerminded in purpose can make you an intolera~
ble bore, especially in the arts. The Renaissance painter Paolo Uccello was
so obsessed with perspective that his paintings look lifeless and contrived.
Whereas Leonardo da Vinci
interested himself in everything«-architec-
ture, painting, warfare, sculpture, mechanics. Diffusion was the source of
his power. But such genius is rare, and the rest of us are better off erring on
the side of intensity.

COURT .‘3(C)ClE&#x27;l‘Y
It is a fact of human nature that the structure of a court society forms itself
around power. In the past,‘ the court gathered around the ruler, and had
many functions: Besides keeping the ruler amused, it was a way to solidify
the hierarchy of royalty, nobility, and the upper classes, and to keep the
nobility both subordinate and close to the ruler, so that he could keep an
eye on them. The court serves power in many ways, but most of all it glori-
lles the ruler, providing him with a microcosmic world that must snuggle
to please him.

To be a courtier was a dangerous game. A nineteentl1—century Arab
in what is now Sudan, reported that
traveler to the court of Darfur,
courtiers there had to do whatever the sultan did: If he were injured, they
had to suffer the same injury; if he fell off his horse during a hunt, they fell,
too. Mimicry like this appeared in couirs all over the world. More trouble
some was the danger of displeasing the ruler-—-one wrong move spelled
death or exile. The successful courtier had to walk a tightrope, pleasing but
not pleasing too much, obeying but somehow distinguishing himself from
the other courtiers, while also never distinguishing himself so far as to
make the ruler insecure.

Great courtiers throughout history have mastered the science of ma-
nipulating people. They make the king feel more kingly; they make every-
one else fear their power. They are magicians of appearance, knowing that
most things at court are judged by how they seem. Great coui-tiers are grate
citrus and polite; their aggression is veiled and indirect, Masters of the
word, they never say more than necessary, getting the most out of a corn-
pliment or hidden insult. They are magnets of pleasure—people want to be
around them because they know how to please, yet they neither fawn nor
humiliate themselves. Great courtiers become the king’s favorites, enjoying
the benefits of that position. They often end up more powerful than the
ruler, for they are wizards in the accumulation of influence.

Many today dismiss court life as a relic of the past, a historical curios-
ity. They reason, according to Machiavelli, “as though heaven, the sun, the
elements, and men had changed the order of their motions and power, and
were different from what they were in ancient limes.” There may be no
more Sun Kings but there are still plenty of people who believe the sun re-
volves around them. The royal court may have more or less disappeared,
or at least lost its power, but courts and courtlers still exist because power
still exists. A courtier is rarely asked to fall off a horse anymore, but the
laws that govern court politics are as timeless as the laws of power. There is
much to be leamed, then, from great courtiers past and present.

the more suspicion you cause. You also stir up enough envy among your
peers to induce treachery and backstabbing. Be careful, ever so careful, in
trumpeting your own achievements, and always talk less about yourself
than about other people. Modesty is generally preferable.

Practice Nonchalance. Never seem to be working too hard. Your talent
must appear to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people take you for
a genius rather than a workaholic. Even when something demands a lot of
sweat, make it look effortless——people prefer to not see your blood and toil,
which is another form of ostentation. It is better for them to marvel at how
gracefully you have achieved your accomplishment than to wonder why it
took so much work.

Be Frugal with Flattery. It may seem that your superiors cannot get
enough flattery, but too much of even a good thing loses its value. It also
stirs up suspicion among your peers. Learn to flatter indirectly—by down-
playing your own contribution, for example, to make your master look bet-
ter.

Arrange to Be Noticed. There is a. paradox: You cannot display yourself
too brazenly, yet you must also get yourself noticed. In the court of Louis
XIV, whoever the king decided to look at rose instantly in the court hierar-
chy. You stand no chance of rising if the ruler does not notice you in the
swamp of courtiers. This task requires much art. It is often initially a matter
of being seen, in the literal sense. Pay attention to your physical appear-
ance, then, and find a way to create a dis1inctive—-a subtly distinctive-style
and image.

Alter Your Style and Language According to the Person You Are
Dealing With. The pseudo-belief in equa.lity——the idea that talking and
acting the same way with everyone, no matter what their rank, makes you
somehow a paragon of civilization—is a terrible mistake. Those below you
will take it as a form of condescension, which it is, and those above you will
be ofiended, although they may not admit it. You must change your style
and your way of speaking to suit each person. This is not lying, it is acting,
and acting is an art, not a gift from God. Learn the art. This is also true for
the great variety of cultures found in the modern court: Never assume that
your criteria of behavior and judgment are universal. Not only is an inabil-
ity to adapt to another culture the height of barbarism, it puts you at a dis-
advantage.

Never Be the Bearer of Bad News. The king kills the messenger who
brings bad news: This is a cliche but there is truth to it. You must struggle
and if necessary lie and cheat to be sure that the lot of the bearer of bad
news falls on a colleague, never on you. Bring only good news and your
approach will gladden your master.

Never Afiect Friendliness and Intimacy with Your Master. He does
not want a friend for a subordinate, he wants a subordinate. Never ap-
proach him in an easy, friendly way, or act as if you are on the best of
ten&#x27;ns—that is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal with you on this level,
assume a wary nhumminess. Otherwise err in the opposite direction, and
make the distance between you clear.

Never Criticize Those Above You Directly. This may seem obvious,
but there are often times when some sort of criticism is necessary—to say
nothing, or to give no advice, would open you to risks of another sort. You
must learn, however, to couch your advice and criticism as indirectly and as
politely as possible. Think twice, or three times, before deciding you have
made them sufficiently circuitous. Err on the side of subtlety and gentleness.

Be Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favors. Nothing imitates a
master more than having to reject someone’s request It stirs up guilt and
resentment. Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know when to stop.
Rather than making yourself the supplicant, it is always better to earn your
favors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly. Most important: Do not ask
for favors on another person’s behalf, least of all a friend’s.

Never joke About Appearances or Taste. A lively wit and a humorous
disposition are essential qualifies for a good courtier, and there are times
when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid any kind of joke
about appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas, especially with those
above you. Do not even try it when you are away from them. You will dig
your own grave.

Do Not Be the Court Cynic. Express admiration for the good work of
others. If you constantly criticize your equals or subordinates some of that
criticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a gray cloud wherever
you go. People will groan at each new cynical comment, and you will irn&#x27;~
tate them. By expressing modest admiration for other people’s achieve-
ments, you paradoxically call attention to your own. The ability to express
wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying tal-
ent, but one still greatly valued.

Be Self-observant. The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you
would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also need a mir-
ror for your actions. This can sometimes come from other people telling
you what they see in you, but that is not the most trustworthy method: Ybu
must be the mirror, training your mind to try to see yourself as others see
you. Are you acting too obsequious? Are you trying too hard to please? Do
you seem desperate for attention, giving the impression that you are on the
decline? Be observant about yourself and you will avoid a mountain of
blunders.

LAW 24

‘

131

Master Your Emotions. As an actor in a great play, you must learn to cry
and laugh on command and when it is appropriate. You must be able both
to disguise your anger and frustration and to fake your contentment and
agreement. You must be the master of your own face, Call it lying if you
like; but if you prefer to not play the game and to always be honest and up-
front, do not complain when others call you obnoxious and arrogant.

Fit the Spirit of the Tunes. A slight affectation of a past era can be
charming, as long as you choose a period at least twenty years back; wear-
ing the fashions of ten years ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the role of
court jester. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with the times,
even if the times offend your sensibilities. Be too forward-thinking, how-
ever, and no one will understand you. It is never a good idea to stand out
too much in this area; you are best off at least being able to mimic the spirit
of the times.

Be a Source of Pleasure. This is critical. It is an obvious law of human
nature that we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful, while charm and
the promise of delight will draw us like moths to a flame. Make yourself the
flame and you will rise to the top. Since life is otherwise so full of unpleas-
antness and pleasure so scarce, you will be as indispensable as food and
drink. This may seem obvious, but what is obvious is often ignored or un-
appreciabed. There are degrees to this: Not everyone can play the role of
favorite, for not everyone is blessed with charm and wit. But we can all
control our unpleasant qualities and obscure them when necessary.

A man who knows the court is master of his gestures, qfhis eyes and
of his face; he is pmjrmml, imfienetrable; hr diisimulates bad offices,
smiles at his enemies, amtmls his inflation, disguises his passions,
belies his heart, speaks and acts against his feelings.

SCENES OF COURT Ll FE: Exemplary Deeds and Fatal Mistakes

Scene 1
Alexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and the Mid-
dle East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his tutor and men-
tor, and throughout his short life he remained devoted to philosophy and
his master’s teachings. He once complained to Aristotle that during his
long campaigns he had no one with whom he could discuss philosophical
matters. Aristotle responded by suggesting that he take Callisthenes, a for-
mer pupil of Aristotle’s and a promising philosopher in his own right,
along on the next campaign.

Aristotle had schooled Callisthenes in the skills of being a courtier, but

182

LAW &#x27;24

the young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure philosophy, in
Imadorned words, in speaking the naked truth. If Alexander loved learning
so much, Callisthenes thought, he could not object to one who spoke his
mind. During one of Alexander’s major campaigns, Callisthenes spoke his
mind one too many times and Alexander had him put to death.
Interpretation
In court, honesty is a fool’s game. Never be so self-absorbed as to believe
that the master is interested in your criticisms of him, no matter how accu-
rate they are.

Scene II
Beginning in the Han Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese scholars
compiled a series of writings called the 27 Histories, an official biography of
each dynasty, including stories, statistics, census figures, and war chroni-
cles. Each history also contained a chapter called “Unusual Events,” and
here, among the listings of earthquakes and floods, there would sometimes
suddenly appear descriptions of such bizarre manifestations as two—headed
sheep, geese flying backward, stars suddenly appearing in different parts of
the sky, and so on. The earthquakes could be historically verified, but the
monsters and weird natural phenomena were clearly inserted on purpose,
and invariably occurred in clusters. What could this mean?

The Chinese emperor was considered more than a man—he was a
force of nature. His kingdom was the center of the universe, and every-
thing revolved around him. He embodied the world’s perfection. To criti-
cize him or any of his actions would have been to criticize the divine order.
No minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with even the slightest
cautionary word. But emperors were fallihle and the kingdom suffered
greatly by their mistakes. Inserting sightings of strange phenomena into the
court chronicles was the only way to warn them. The emperor would read
of geese flying backward and moons out of orbit, and realize that he was
being cautioned. His actions were unbalancing the universe and needed to
change.
interpretation
For Chinese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor advice was
an important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had died trying to
warn or counsel their master. To be made safely, their criticisms had to be
indirect--yet if they were ton indirect they would not be heeded. The
chronicles were their solution: Identify no one person as the source of criti«
cism, make the advice as impersonal as possible, but let the emperor know
the gravity of the situation.

Your master is no longer the center of the universe, but he still imag-
ines that everything revolves around him. When you criticize him he sees
the person criticizing, not the criticism itself. Like the Chinese courtiers,
you must find a way to disappear behind the warning. Use symbols and
other indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems to come, without
putting your neck on the line.

Scene III
Early in his career, the French architect Jules Mansart received commis-
sions to design minor additions to Versailles for King Louis XIV. For each
design he would draw up his plans, making sure they followed Louis’s in-
structions closely. He would then present them to His Majesty.

The courtier Saint-Simon described MansaIt’s technique in dealing
with the king: “His particular skill was to show the king plans that pur»
posely included something imperfect about them, often dealing with the
gardens, which were not Mansart’s specialty. The king, as Mansart ex-
pected, would put his finger exactly on the problem and propose how to
solve it, at which point Mansart would exclaim for all to hear that he would
never have seen the problem that the king had so masterfully found and
solved; he would burst with admiration, confessing that next to the king he
was but a lowly pupil.” At the age of thirty, having used these methods
time and time again, Mansart received a prestigious royal commission: Al:
though he was less talented and experienced than a number of other
French designers, he was to take charge of the enlargement of Versailles.
He was the king’s architect from then on.
Interpretation
As a young man, Mansart had seen how many royal craftsmen in the sen
vice of Louis XIV had lost their positions not through a lack of talent but
through a costly social blunder. He would not make that mistake. Mansart
always strove to make Louis feel better about himself, to feed the king’s
vanity as publicly as possible.

Never imagine that skill and talent are all that matter. In court the
courtier’s art is more important than his talent; never spend so much time
on your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the greatest skill of
all is the ability to make the master look more talented than those around
him.

Scene IV
Jean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial painter of the Napoleonic
court. During the Congress of Vienna in 1814, after Napoleon, defeated,
had been imprisoned on the island of Elba, the participants in these meet-
ings, which were to decide the fate of Europe, invited Isabey to immortal-
ize the historic events in an epic painting.

When Isabey arrived in Vienna, Talleyrand, the main negotiator for
the French, paid the artist a visit. Considering his role in the proceedings,
the statesman explained, he expected to occupy center stage in the paint-
ing. Isabey cordially agreed. A few days later the Duke of Wellington, the
main negotiator for the English, also approached Isabey, and said much
the same thing that Talleyrand had. The ever polite Isabey agreed that the
great duke should indeed he the center of attention.

Back in his studio, Isabey pondered the dilemma. If he gave the spot-
light to either of the two men, he could create a diplomatic rift, stirring up
all sorts of resentment at a time when peace and concord were critical.

I 84

LAW 24

When the painting was finally unveiled, however, both Talleyrand and
Wellington felt honored and satisfied. The work depicts a large hall filled
with diplomats and politicians from allover Europe. 011 one side the Duke
of Wellington enters the room, and all eyes are turned toward him; he is
the “center” of attention. In the very center of the painting, meanwhile, sits
Talleyiand.
Interpretafion
It is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two masters in
one stroke takes the genius of a great courtier. Such predicaments are comw
mon in the life of a courtier: By giving attention to one master, he dis-
pleases another. You must find a way to navigate this Scylla and Charybdis
safely. Masters must receive their due; never inadvertently stir up the re
sentment of one in pleasing another.

Scene V
George Brummell, also known as Beau Brummell, made his mark in the
late 1700s by the supreme elegance of his appearance, his popularization of
shoe buckles (soon imitated by all the dandies). and his clever way with
words. His London house was the fashionable spot in town, and Brunnnell
was the authority on all matters of fashion. If he disliked your footwear,
you immediately got rid of it and bought whatever he was wearing. He per-
fected the art of tying a cravat; Lord Byron was said to spend many a night
in front of the mirror trying to figure out the secret behind Brummell’s per-
fect knots.

One of Brummell’s greatest admirers was the Prince of Wales, who
fancied himself a fashionable young man. Becoming attached to the
prince’s court (and provided with a royal pension), Brummell was soon so
sure of his‘ own authority there that he took to joking about the prince’s
weight, referring to his host as Big Ben. Since trimness of figure was an im~
portant quality for a. dandy, this was a withering criticism. At dinner once,
when the service was slow, Brummell said to the prince, “Do ting, Big
Ben” The prince rang, but when the valet arrived he ordered the man to
show Brummell the door and never admit him again.

Despite falling into the prince’s disfavor, Brummell continued to treat
everyone around him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince of
Wales’ patronage to support him, he sank into horrible debt, but he main
tained his insolent manners, and everyone soon abandoned him. He died
in the most pitiahle poverty, alone and deranged.
Interpretation
Beau Brummell’s devastating wit was one of the qualifies that endeared
him to the Prince of Wales. But not even he, the arbiter of taste and fashion,
could get away with a joke about the prince’s appearance, least of all to his
face. Never joke about a person’s plumpness, even indirectly—and particu*
larly when he is your master. The poorhouses of history are filled with peo-
ple who have made such jokes at their master’s expense.

Scene VI
Pope Urban VIII wanted to be remembered for his skills in writing poetry,
which unfortunately were mediocre at best.
In 1629 Duke Francesco
d’Este, knowing the pope’s literary pretensions, sent the poet Fulvio Testi
as his ambassador to the Vatican. One of Tes|i’s letters to the duke reveals
why he was chosen: “Once our discussion was over, I kneeled to depart,
but His Holiness made a signal and walked to another room where he
sleeps, and after reaching a small table, he grabbed at bundle of papers and
thus, turning to me with a smiling face, he said: ‘We want Your Lordship to
listen to some of our compositions.’ And, in fact, he read me two very long
Pindaric poems, one in praise of the most hoiy Virgin, and the other one
about Countess Matilde.”

We do not know exactly what Testi thought of these very long poems,
since it would have been dangerous for him to state his opinion freely,
even in a letter. But he went on to write, “I, following the mood, com-
mented on each line with the needed praise, and, after having kissed His
Holiness’s foot for such an unusual sign of benevolence [the reading of the
poetry], I left.” Weeks later, when the duke himself visited the pope, he
managed to recite entire verses of the pope’s poetry and praised it enough
to make the pope “so jubilant he seemed to lose his mind.”
Interpretation
In matters of taste you can never be too obsequious with your master. Taste
is one of the ego’s pxickliest parts; never impugn or question the master’s
taste-——his poetry is sublime, his dress impeccable, and his manner the
model for all.

_

Scene VII
One afternoon in ancient China, Chao, ruler of Han from 358 to 333 B.C.,
got drunk and fell asleep in the palace gardens. The court crown-keeper,
whose sole task was to look after the ruler’s head apparel, passed through
the gardens and saw his master sleeping without a coat. Since it was getting
cold, the crowrrkeeper placed his own coat over the ruler, and left.

‘

When Chan awoke and saw the coat upon him, he asked his axten»
dants, “Who put more clothes on my body?” “The crowmkeeper,” they
replied. The ruler immediately called for his ofiicial coat—keeper and had
him punished for neglecting his duties. He also called for the crown-
keeper, whom he had beheaded.
Interpretation
Do not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do, to the best
of your abilities, and never do more. To think that by doing more you are
doing better is a common blunder. It is never good to seem to be trying too
ha.rd——-it is as if you were covering up some deficiency. Fulfilling a task that
has not been asked of you just makes people suspicious. If you are a crown-
keeper, be a crowmkeeper. Save your excess energy for when you are not
in the court.

Scene VIII
One day, for amusement, the Italian Renaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi
(1406-1469) and some friends went sailing in a small boat off Ancona.
There they were captured by two Moorish galleys, which hauled them off
in chains to Barbary, where they were sold as slaves. For eighteen long
months Filippo toiled with no hope of returning to Italy.

On several occasions Filippo saw the man who had bought him pass
by, and one day he decided to sketch this man’s portrait, using burnt
coal~charcoal—from the fire. Still in his chains, he found a white wall,
where he drew a full—length likeness of his owner in Moorish clothing. The
owner soon heard about this, for no one had seen such skill in drawing be-
fore in these parts; it seemed like a miracle, 3. gift from God. The drawing
so pleased the owner that be instantly gave Filippo his freedom and em—
ployed him in his court. All the big men on the Barbary coast came to see
the magnificent color portraits that Fra Filippo then proceeded to do, and
finally, in gratitude for the honor in this way brought upon him, Filippcfs

We who toil for other people have all in some way been captured by pi-
rates and sold into slavery. But like Fra Filippo (if to a lesser degree), most
of us possess some gift, some talent, an ability to do something better than
other people. Make your master a gift of your talents and you will rise
above other courtiers. Let him take the credit if necessary, it will only be
temporary: Use him as a stepping stone, a way of displaying your talent
and eventually buying your freedom from enslavernent.

Scene IX
Alfonso I of Aragon once had a servant who told the king that the night
before he had had a dream: Alfonso had given him a gift of weapons,
horses, and clothes. Alfonso, a generous, lordly man, decided it would be
amusing to make this dream come true, and promptly gave the servant
exactly these gifts.

A little while later, the same servant announced to Alfonso that he had
had yet another dream, and in this one Alfonso had given him a consider-
able pile of gold florins. The king smiled and said, “Don&#x27;t believe in
dreams from now on; they lie.”
interpretation
In his treatment of the servant’s first dream, Alfonso remained in control.
By making a dream come true, he claimed a godlike power for himself, if
in a mild and humorous way. In the second dream, however, all appear-
ance of magic was gone; this was nothing but an ugly con game on the set»
vant’s part. Never ask for too much, then, and know when to stop. It is the
master’s prerogative to give——to give when he wants and what he wants,
and to do so without prompting. Do not give him the chance to reject your
requests. Better to win favors by deserving them, so that they are bestowed
without your asking.

Scene X
The great English landscape painter M. W. Turner (1775-1851) was
known for his use of color, which he applied with a brilliance and a strange
iridescence. The color in his paintings was so striking, in fact, that other
artists never wanted his work hung next to theirs: It inevitably made every-
thing around it seem dull.

The painter Sir Thomas Lawrence once had the misfortune of seeing
Turner’s masterpiece Cologne hanging in an exhibition between two works
of his own. Lawrence complained bitterly to the gallery owner, who gave
him no satisfaction: After all, someone’: paintings had to hang next to
Tumer’s. But Turner heard of Lawrence’s complaint, and before the exhibi-
tion opened, he toned down the brilliant golden sky in Cologne, making it as
dull as the colors in Lawrence’s works. A friend of Tumer’s who saw the
painting approached the artist with a horrified look: “What have you done
to your picture!” he said. “Well, poor Lawrence was so unhappy,” Turner
replied, “and it’s only lampblack. It’ll wash off after the exhibition.”
Interpretation
Many of a courtier’s anxieties have to do with the master, with whom most
dangers lie. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that the master is the only one to
determine your fate. Your equals and subordinates play integral parts also.
A court is a vast stew of resentments, fears, and powerful envy. You have to
placate everyone who might someday harm you, deflecting their resent-
ment and envy and diverting their hostility onto other people.

Turner, eminent courtier, knew that his good fortune and fame de
pended on his fellow painters as well as on his dealers and patrons. How
many of the great have been felled by envious colleagues! Better temporar-
ily to dull your brilliance than to suffer the slings and arrows of envy.

Scene XI
Winston Churchill was an amateur artist, and after World War II his paint-
ings became collector’s items. The American publisher Henry Luce, in
fact, creator of Time and L2)? magazines, kept one of Churchill’s landscapes
hanging in his private office in New York.

On a tour through the United States once, Churchill visited Luce in his
office, and the two men looked at the painting together. The publisher re-
marked, “It’s a good picture, but I think it needs something in the fore-
ground-—a sheep, perhaps.” Much to Luce’s horror, Churcl1ill’s secretary
called the publisher the next day and asked him to have the painting sent
to England. Luce did so, mortified that he had perhaps offended the former
prime minister. A few days later, however, the painting was shipped back,
but slightly altered: a single sheep now grazed peacefully in the fore
ground.
Interpretation
In stature and fame, Churchill stood head and shoulders above Luce, but
Luce was certainly a man of power, so let us imagine a slight equality be-
tween them. Still, what did Churchill have to fear from an American pub
lisher? Why bow to the criticism of a dilettante?

‘

LAW 24

A court-—-in this case the entire world of diplomats and international
statesmen, and also of the journalists who court them--is a place of mutual
dependence. It is unwise to insult or olifend the taste of people of power,
even if they are below or equal to you. If 3. man like Churchill can swallow
the criticisms of a man like Luce, he proves himself a courtier without peer.
(Perhaps his correction of the painting implied a certain condescension as
well, but he did it so subtly that Luce did not perceive any slight.) lmitate
Churchill: Put in the sheep. It is always beneficial to play the obliging
courtier, even when you are not serving a master.

THE DELEGATE GAME OF COURTIERSHIP: A Warning
Talleyraud was the consummate courtier, especially in serving his master
Napoleon. When the two men were first getting to know each other,
Napoleon once said in passing, “I shall come to lunch at your house one of
these days.” Talleyrancl had a house at Auteuil, in the suburbs of Paris. “I
should be delighted, man général,” the minister replied, “and since my
house is close to the Bois de Boulogne, you will be able to amuse yourself
with a bit of shooting in the afternoon.”

“I do not like shooting,” said Napoleon, “But I love hunting. Are there
any boars in the Bois de Boulogne?” Napoleon came from Corsica, where
boar hunting was a great sport. By asking if there were boars in at Paris
park, he showed himself still a. provincial, almost a tube. Talleyrand did not
laugh, however, but he could not resist a practical joke on the man who
was now his master in politics, although not in blood and nobility, since
Talleyrand came from an old aristocratic family. To Napoleorfs question,
then, he simply replied, “Very few, man généml, but I dare say you will man-
age to find one.”

It was arranged that Napoleon would arrive at Talleyrand’s house the
following day at seven AM. and would spend the morning there. The “boar
hunt” would take place in the afternoon. Throughout the morning the ex-
cited general talked nothing but boar hunting. Meanwhile, Talleyrand see
cretly had his servants go to the market, buy two enormous black pigs, and
take them to the great park.

After lunch,

the hunters and their hounds set off for the Bois de
Boulogne. At a secret signal from Talleyrand, the servants loosed one of the
pigs. “I see a boar,” Napoleon cried joyfully, jumping onto his horse to give
chase. Talleyrand stayed behind. It took half an hour of galloping through
the park before the “boat” was finally captured. At the moment of triumph,
however, Napoleon was approached by one of his aides, who knew the
creature could not possibly be at boar, and feared the general would be
ridiculed once the story got out: “Sir,” he told Napoleon, “you realize of
course that this is not a bear but a pig.”

Flying into a rage, Napoleon immediately set off at a gallop for Tal-
leyrand’s house. He realized along the way that he would now be the butt
of many a joke, and that exploding at Talleyrand would only make him

&#x27;

LAW 24

199

more ridiculous; it would be better to make a show of good humor. Still, he
did not hide his displeasure well.

Talleyrand decided to try to soothe the general’s bruised ego. He told
Napoleon not to go back to Paris yet-«he should again go hunting in the
park. There were many rabbits there, and hunting them had been a. fa-
vorite pastime of Louis XVI. Talleyrand even offered to let Napoleon use a
set of guns that had once belonged to Louis. With much flattery and cajol—
ery, he once again got Napoleon to agree to a hunt.

The party left for the park in the late afternoon. Along the way,
Napoleon told Talleyrand, “Pm not Louis XVI, I surely won’t kill even one
rabbit.” Yet that afternoon, strangely enough, the park was teeming with
rabbits. Napoleon killed at least fifty of them, and his mood changed from
anger to satisfaction. At the end of his wild shooting spree, however, the
same aide approached him and whispered in his ear, “To tell the truth, sir, I
am beginning to believe these are not wild rabbits. I suspect that rascal T31»
leyrand has played another joke on us.” (The aide was right: Talleyrand
had in fact sent his servants back to the market, where they had purchased
dozens of rabbits and then had released them in the Bois de Boulogne.)

Napoleon immediately mounted his horse and galloped away, this
time returning straight to Paris. He later threatened Talleyrand, warned
him not to tell a soul what had happened; if he became the laughingstock
of Paris, there would be hell to pay.

It took months for Napoleon to be able to trust Talleyrand again, and

he never totally forgave him his humiliation.

Interpretation
Courtiers are like magicians: They deceptively play with appearances,
only letting those around them see what they want them to see. With so
much deception and manipulation afoot, it is essential to keep people from
seeing your tricks and glimpsing your sleight of hand.

Talleyrand was normally the Grand Vlfizard of Courtiership, and but
for Napoleoifs aide, he probably would have gotten away completely with
both pleasing his master and having a joke at the generafs expense. But
courtiership is a subtle art, and overlooked traps and inadvertent mistakes
can ruin your best tricks. Never risk being caught in your maneuvers;
never let people see your devices. If that happens you instantly pass in peo
ple’s perceptions from a courtier of great manners to a loathsome rogue. It
is a delicate game you play; apply the utmost attention to covering your
tracks, and never let your master unmask you.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
Julius Caesar made his first significant mark on Roman society in 65 B.C.,
when he assumed the post of aedile, the official in charge of grain distribu-
tion and public games. He began his entrance into the public eye by orga~
nizing a series of carefully crafted and well~timed spectac|es——wi1d—beast
hunts, extravagant gladiator shows, theatrical contests. On several occa-
sions, he paid for these spectacles out of his own pocket. To the common
man, Julius Caesar became indelibly associated with these muclrloved
events. As he slowly rose to attain the position of consul, his popularity
among the masses served as the foundation of his power. He had created
an image of himself as a great public showman.

In 49 B.C., Rome was on the brink of a civil war between rival leaders,
Caesar and Pompey. At the height of the tension, Caesar, an addict of the
stage, attended a theatrical performance, and afterward, lost in thought, he
wandered in the darkness back to his camp at the Rubicon, the rivet that
divides Italy from Gaul, where he had been campaigning. To march his
army back into Italy across the Rubicon would mean the beginning of a
war with Pompey.

Before his staff Caesar argued both sides, forming the options like an
actor on stage, a. precursor of Hamlet. Finally, to put his soliloquy to an
end, he pointed to a seemingly innocent appaxition at the edge of the
river——a very tall soldier blasting a call on a trumpet, then going across a
bridge over the Rubicon————a.nd pronounced, “Let us accept this as a sign
from the Gods and follow where they beckon, in vengeance on our double»
dealing enemies. The die is cast.” All of this he spoke portentously and dra-
matically, gesturing toward the river and looking his generals in the eye.
He knew that these generals were uncertain in their support, but his ora-
tory overwhelmed them with a sense of the drama of the moment, and of
the need to seize the time. A more prosaic speech would never have had
the same effect. The generals rallied to his cause; Caesar and his army
crossed the Rubicon and by the following year had vanquished Pompey,
making Caesar dictator of Rome.

In warfare, Caesar always played the leading man with gusto. He was
as skilled a horseman as any of his soldiers, and took pride in outdoing
them in feats of bravery and endurance, He entered battle astzide the
strongest mount, so that his soldiers would see him in the thick of battle,
urging them on, always positioning himself in the center, a godlike symbol
of power and a model for them to follow, Of all the armies in Rome, Cae-
sar’s was the most devoted and loyal. His soldiers, like the common people
who had attended his entertainments, had come to identify with him and
with his cause.

After the defeat of Pompey, the entertainments grew in scale. Nothing
like them had ever been seen in Rome. The chariot races became more
spectacular, the gladiator fights more dramatic, as Caesar staged fights to
the death among the Roman nobility. He organized enormous mock naval
battles on an artificial lake. Plays were performed in every Roman ward. A

giant new theater was built that sloped dramatically down the Tarpeian
Rock. Crowds from all over the empire flocked to these events, the roads to
Rome lined with visitors’ tents. And in 45 B.C., timing his entry into the city
for maximum effect and surprise, Caesar brought Cleopatra back to Rome
after his Egyptian campaign, and staged even more extravagant public
spectacles.

These events were more than devices to divert the masses; they dra~
matically enhanced the public’s sense of Caesar’s character, and made him
seem larger than life. Caesar was the master of his public image, of which
he was forever aware. When he appeared before crowds he wore the most
spectacular purple robes. He would be upstaged by no one. He was notori-
ously vain about his appearance—it was said that one reason he enjoyed
being honored by the Senate and people was that on these occasions he
could wear a laurel wreath, hiding his baldness. Caesar was a masterful or-
ator. He knew how to say a lot by saying a little, intuited the moment to
end a speech for maximum effect. He never failed to incorporate a surprise
into his public appearances—a startling announcement
that would
heighten their drama.

Immensely popular among the Roman people, Caesar was hated and
feared by his rivals. On the ides of March——March 15—in the year 44 B.C.,
a group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded him in the
senate and stabbed him to death. Even dying, however, he kept his sense of
drama. Drawing the top of his gown over his face, he let go of the cloth’s
lower part so that it draped his legs, allowing him to die covered and de-
cent. According to the Roman historian Suetonius, his final words to his
old friend Brutus, who was about to deliver a second blow, were in Greek,
and as if rehearsed for the end of a play: “You too, my child?”

Interpretation
The Roman theater was an event for the masses, attended by crowds
unimaginable today. Packed into enormous auditoriums,
the audience
would be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy. Theater
seemed to contain the essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic form.
Like a religious ritual, it had a powerful, instant appeal to the common

man.

Julius Caesar was perhaps the first public figure to understand the vital
link between power and theater. This was because of his own obsessive in»
terest in drama. He sublimated this interest by making himself an actor and
director on the world stage. He said his lines as if they had been scripted;
he gestured and moved through a crowd with a constant sense of how he
appeared to his audience. He incorporated surprise into his repertoire,
building drama into his speeches, staging into his public appearances. His
gestures were broad enough for the common man to grasp them instantly.
He became immensely popular.‘

Caesar set the ideal for all leaders and people of power. Like him, you
must leam to enlarge your actions through dramatic techniques such as

LAW 25

19.?

surprise, suspense, the creation of sympathy, and symbolic identification.
Also like him, you must be constantly aware of your audience——of what
will please them and what will bore them. You must arrange to place your-
self at the center, to command attention, and never to be upstaged at any
cost.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In the year 1831, a young woman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant left her
husband and family in the provinces and moved to Paris. She wanted to be
a writer; marriage, she felt, was worse than prison, for it left her neither the
time nor the freedom to pursue her passion. In Paris she would establish
her independence and make her living by writing.

Soon after Dudevant arrived in the capital, however, she had to con
front certain harsh realities. To have any degree of freedom in Paris you
had to have money. For a woman, money could only come through mar»
rlage or prostitution. No woman had ever come close to making a living by
writing. Women wrote as a hobby, supported by their husbands, or by an
inheritance. In fact when Dudevant first showed her writing to an editor,
he told her, “You should make babies, Madame, not literature,”

Clearly Dudevant had come to Paris to attempt the impossible. In the
end, though, she came up with a strategy to do what no woman had ever
donew-a strategy to re-create herself completely, forging a public image of
her own making. Women writers before her had been forced into a ready-
that of the second-rate arfist who wrote mostly for other
made role,
women. Dudevant decided that if she had to play a role, she would turn the
game around: She would play the part of a man.

In 1832 a publisher accepted Dudevanfs first major novel, Indium.
She had chosen to publish it under a pseudonym, “George Sand,” and all
of Paris assumed this impressive new writer was male. Dudevant had
sometimes worn men’s clothes before creating “George Sand” (she had al-
ways found men‘s shirts and riding breeches more comfortable); now, as
a public figure, she exaggerated the image. She added long men’s coats,
gray hats, heavy boots, and dandyish cravats to her wardrobe. She smoked
cigars and in conversation expressed herself like a man, unafraid to domiv
nate the conversation or to use a. saucy word,

This strange “male/female” writer fascinated the public. And unlike
other women writers, Sand found herself accepted into the clique of male
artists. She drank and smoked with them, even carried on affairs with the
most famous artists of Europe—Musset, Liszt, Chopin. It was she who did
the wooing, and also the abandoning-—she moved on at her discretion.

Those who knew Sand well understood that her male persona pro-
tected her from the public’s prying eyes. Out in the world, she enjoyed
playing the part to the extreme; in private she remained herself. She also
realized that the character of “George Sand” could grow stale or pre-
dictable, and to avoid this she would every now and then dramatically alter

194

L AW 25

the character she had created; instead of conducting affairs with famous
men, she would begin meddling in politics, leading demonstrations, inspir-
ing student rebellions. No one would dictate to her the limits of the charac-
ter she had created. Long after she died, and after most people had stopped
reading her novels, the larger-than—life theatricality of that character has
continued to fascinate and inspire.

Interpretation
Throughout Sand’s public life, acquaintances and other artists who spent
time in her company had the feeling they were in the presence of a man.
But in her journals and to her closest friends, such as Gustave Flaubert, she
confessed that she had no desire to be a man, but was playing a part for
public consumption. What she really wanted was the power to determine
her own character. She refused the limits her society would have set on her.
She did not attain her power, however, by being herself; instead she cre-
ated a persona that she could constantly adapt to her own desires, a per-
sona that attracted attention and gave her presence.

Understand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And
once you accept that role you are doomed. Your power is limited to the
tiny amount allotted to the role you have selected or have been forced to
assume. An actor, on the other hand, plays many roles. Enjoy that protean
power, and if it is beyond you, at least forge a new identity, one of your
own making, one that has had no boundaries assigned to it by an envious
and resentful world. This act of defiance is Promethean: It makes you re»
sponsible for your own creation.

Your new identity will protect you from the world precisely because it
is not “you”; it is a costume you put on and take off. You need not take it
personally. And your new identity sets you apart, gives you theatrical pres-
ence. Those in the back rows can see you and hear you. Those in the front
rows marvel at your audacity.

Do not people talk in society of a man being a great actor? They do not mean by
that that he/&quot;eels, but that he excels in simulating, though hefeels nothing.
I)»m,i.r I)iderot, 1713-1 784

KEYS TO POWER
The character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily who you
are; beyond the characteristics you have inherited, your parents, your
friends, and your peers have helped to shape your personality. The
Promethean task of the powerful is to take control of the process, to stop al-
lowing others that ability to limit and mold them. Remake yourself into a
character of power. Working on yourself like clay should be one of your
greatest and most pleasurable life tasks. It makes you in essence an a11ist—
an artist creating yourself.

In fact, the idea of self—creation comes from the world of art. For thou-

LAW 25

195

sands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the freedom to
shape their public image and determine their own identity. Similarly, only
kings and the wealthiest lords could contemplate their own image in art,
and consciously alter it. The rest of mankind played the limited role that
society demanded of them, and had little selficonsciousness.

A shift in this condition can be detected in Velézquez’s painting La:
Marinas, made in 1656. The artist appears at the left of the canvas, standing
before a painting that he is in the process of creating. but that has its back
to us——-we cannot see it. Beside him stands a princess, her attendanw, and
one of the court dwarves, all watching him work. The people posing for the
painting are not directly visible, but we can see them in tiny reflections in a
mirror on the back wal]—-—the king and queen of Spain, who must be sitting
somewhere in the foreground, outside the picture.

The painting represents a dramatic change in the dynamics of power
and the ability to determine one’s own position in society. For Velazquez,
the artist, is far more prominently positioned than the king and queen. In a
sense he is more powerful than they are, since he is clearly the one control»
ling the irnage--their image. Velazquez no longer saw himself as the slav-
ish, dependent artist. He had remade himself into a man of power. And
indeed the first people other than aristocrats to play openly with their
image in Western society were artists and writers, and later on dandies and
bohemians. Today the concept of selflcreation has slowly filtered down to
the rest of society, and has become an ideal to aspire to. Like Velazquez,
you must demand for yourself the power to determine your position in the
painting, and to create your own image.

The first step in the process of self—creation is self-consciousness-
being aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your appearance
and emotions. As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one who is always sin-
cere. People who wear their hearts on their sleeves out in society are tire-
some and embarrassing. Their sincerity notwithstanding, it is hard to take
them seriously. Those who cry in public may temporarily elicit sympathy,
but sympathy soon turns
self-
obsessiveness-«~they are crying to get attention, we feel, and a malicious
part of us wants to deny them the satisfaction.

to scorn and irritation at

their

Good actors control

themselves better. They can play sincere and
heartfelt, can affect a tear and a compassionate look at will, but they don’t
have to feel it. They externalize emotion in a form that others can under-
stand. Method acting is fatal
in the real world. No ruler or leader could
possibly play the part if all of the emotions he showed had to be real. So
learn self-control. Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can mold his or her
face to the emotion required.

The second step in the process of selflcreation is a Variation on the
George Sand strategy:
the creation of a memorable character, one that
compels attention, that stands out above the other players on the stage.
This was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun, common
country man, he knew, was a kind of president that America had never had

196

LAW 25

but would delight in electing. Although many of these qualifies came natu-
rally to him, he played them up--the hat and clothes, the beard. (No presi-
dent before him had worn a beard.) Lincoln was also the first president to
use photographs to spread his image, helping to create the icon of the
“homespun president.”

Good drama, however, needs more than an interesting appearance, or
a single stand-out moment. Drama takes place over time—~it is an unfold-
ing event Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the most important ele
ments in the rhythm of drama is suspense. Houdini for instance, could
sometimes complete his escape acts in seconds——but he drew them out to
minutes, to make the audience sweat.

The key to keeping the audience on the edge of their seats is letting
events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right moment, accord-
ingto a pattern and tempo that you control. Great rulers from Napoleon to
Mao Tseturig have used theatrical timing to surprise and divert their pub
lic. Franklin Delano Roosevelt understood the importance of staging polio»
cal events in R particular order and rhythm.

At the time of his 1932 presidential election, the United States was in
the midst of a dire economic crisis. Banks were failing at an alarming rate.
Shortly after winning the election, Roosevelt went into at kind of retreat.
He said nothing about his plans or his cabinet appointments, He even re~
fused to meet the sitting president, Herbert Hoover, to discuss the transi-
tion. By the time of Roosevelt’s inauguration the country was in a state of
high anxiety.

In his inaugural address, Roosevelt shifted gears. He made a powerful
speech, making it clear that he intended to lead the country in a completely
new direction, sweeping away the timid gestures of his predecessors. From
then on the pace of his speeches and public decisions——cabinet appoint-
ments, bold legislatiori—~unfolded at an incredibly rapid rate. The period
after the inauguration became known as the “Hundred Days,” and its suc-
cess in altering the country’s mood partly stemmed from Roosevelfs clever
pacing and use of dramatic contrast. He held his audience in suspense,
then hit them with a series of bold gestures that seemed all the more mo-
mentous because they came from nowhere. You must learn to orchestrate
events in a similar manner, never revealing all your cards at once, but un-
folding them in a way that heightens their dramatic effect.

Besides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also confuse and
deceive your enemy. During World War II, the German playwright Bertolt
Brecht worked in Hollywood as a screenwriter. After the war he was called
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities for his supposed
Communist sympathies. Other writers who had been called to testify
planned to humiliate the committee members with an angry emotional
stand. Brecht was wiser: He would play the committee like a violin, charmv
ing them while fooling them as well. He carefully rehearsed his responses,
and brought along some props, notably a cigar on which he puffed away,
knowing the head of the committee hked cigars. And indeed he proceeded

LAW 25

197

to beguile the committee with well—crafted responses that were ambiguous,
funny, and double—edged. Instead of an angry, heartfelt tirade, he ran cir-
cles around them with a staged production, and they let him off scot-free.

Other dramatic effects for your repertoire include the beau geste, an
action at a climactic moment that symbolizes your triumph or your bold-
ness. Caesar’s dramatic crossing of the Rubicon was a beau geste——a move
that dazzled the soldiers and gave him heroic proportions. You must also
appreciate the importance of stage entrances and exits. When Cleopatra
first met Caesar in Egypt, she arrived rolled up in a carpet, which she
arranged to have unfurled at his feet. George Washington twice left power
with flourish and fanfare (first as a general, then as a president who refused
to sit for a third term), showing he knew how to make the moment count,
dramatically and symbolically. Your own entrances and exits should be
crafied and planned as carefully.

Remember that overacting can be counte1productive—it is another
way of spending too much effort trying to attract attention. The actor
Richard Burton discovered early in his career that by standing totally still
onstage, he drew attention to himself and away from the other actors. It is
less what you do that matters, clearly, than how you do it—your graceful-
ness and imposing stillness on the social stage count for more than overdo»
ing your part and moving around too much.

Finally: Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment re»
quires. Adapt your mask to the situation-be protean in the faces you wear.
Bismarck played this game to perfection: To a liberal he was a liberal, to a
hawk he was a hawk. He could not be grasped, and what cannot be
grasped cannot be consumed.

REVERSAL
There can really be no reversal to this critical law: Bad theater is bad the-
ater. Even appearing natural requires a.rt—in other words, acting. Bad act-
ing only creates embarrassment. Of course you should not be too
dramatic—avoid the histfionic gesture. But that is simply bad theater any-
way, since it violates centuries-old dramatic laws against overacting. In
essence there is no reversal to this law.

HAVE A SCAPEGOAT AROUND TO TAKE THE BLAME

Our good name and reputation depend more on what we conceal than on
what we reveal. Everyone makes mistakes, but those who are truly clever
manage to hide them, and to make sure someone else is blamed. A conve-
nient scapegoat should always be kept amzmdfor such moments.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 1
Near the end of the second century A.D., as China’s mighty Han Empire
the great general and imperial minister Ts’ao Ts’ao
slowly collapsed,
emerged as the most powerful man in the country. Seeking to extend his
power base and to rid himself of the last of his rivals, &#x27;Is’ao Ts’ao began a
campaign to take conlrol of the strategically vital Central Plain. During the
siege of a key city, be slightly miscalculoted the timing for supplies of grain
to arrive from the capital. As he waited for the shipment to come in, the
army ran low on food, and Ts’ao Ts’ao was forced to order the chief of
commissariat to reduce its rations.

Ts‘ao Ts’ao kept a tight rein on the army, and ran a network of inform-
ers. His spies soon reported that the men were complaining, grumbling
that he was living well while they themselves had barely enough to eat.
Perhaps Ts’ao Ts’ao was keeping the food for himself, they murmured. If
the grumbling spread, Ts’ao Ts’ao could have a mutiny on his hands. He
summoned the chief of commissariat to his tent

“I want to ask you to lend me something, and you must not refuse,”
Ts’ao Ts’ao told the chief. “What is it?” the chief replied. “I want the loam of
your head to show to the troops,” said Ts’ao Ts’a.o. “But I’ve dope nothing
wrong!” cried the chief. “I know,” said Ts’ao Ts’ao with a sigh, “but if I do
not put you to death, there will be a mutiny. Do not grieve-—a.fter you’re
gone, I’ll look after your family.” Put this way, the request left the chief no
choice, so he resigned himself to his fate and was beheaded that very day.
Seeing his head on public display, the soldiers stopped grumbling. Some
saw through Ts’ao Ts’ao‘s gesture, but kept quiet, stunned and intimidated
by his violence. And most accepted his version of who was to blame, pre-
ferring to believe in his wisdom and fairness than in his incompetence and
cruelty.

Interpretation
Ts’ao Ts’ao came to power in an extremely tumultuous time. In the struggle
for supremacy in the crumbling Han Empire, enemies had emerged from
all sides. The battle for the Central Plain had proven more difficult than he
imagined, and money and provisions were a constant concern. No wonder
that under such stress, he had forgotten to order supplies in time.

Once it became clear that the delay wa.s a critical mistake, and that the
army was seething with mutiny, Ts’ao &#x27;Is’ao had two options: apology and
excuses, or a scapegoat. Understanding the workings of power and the im—

ment: He shopped around for the most convenient head and had it served
up immediately.

Occasional mistakes are inevitable——the world is just

diciable. People of power, however. are undone not by the mistakes they
make, but by the way they deal with them. Like surgeons, they must cut
away the tumor with speed and finality. Excuses and apologies are much
too blunt tools for this delicate operation; the powerful avoid them. By
apologizing you open up all sorts of doubts about your competence, your
intentions, any other mistakes you may not have confessed. Excuses satisfy
no one and apologies make everyone uncomfortable. The mistake does
not vanish with an apology; it deepens and testers. Better to cut it off in-
stantly, distract attention from yourself, and focus attention on a conve
nient scapegoat before people have time to ponder your responsibility or
your possible incompetence.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11
For several years Cesare Borgia campaigned to gain control of large parts
of Italy in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. In the year I500 he
managed to take Romagna, in northern Italy. The region had for years
been ruled by a series of greedy masters who had plundered its wealth for
themselves. Without police or any disciplining force, it had descended into
lawlessness, whole areas being ruled by robbers and feuding families.
To establish order, Cesare appointed a lieutenant general of the region-—
Remixro de Oreo, “a cruel and vigorous man,” according to Niccolo
Machiavelli. Cesare gave the Orco absolute powers.

With energy and violence, de Orco established a severe, brutal justice
in Rornagna, and soon rid it of almost all of its lawless elements. But in his
zeal he sometimes went too far, and after a couple of years the local popu-
lation resented and even hated him. In December of 1502, Cesare took dc»
cisive action. He first let it be known that he had not approved of de Orco’s
cruel and violent deeds, which stemmed from the lieutenanfs brutal na-
ture. Then, on December 22, he imprisoned cle Drco in the town of Ce-
sena, and the day after Christmas the townspeople awoke to find a strange
spectacle in the middle of the piazza: do Orco’s headless body, dressed in a
lavish suit with a purple cape, the head impaled beside it on a pike, the
bloody knife and executioner’s block laid out beside the head. As Machi-
avelli concluded his comments on the affair, “The ferocity of this scene left
the people at once stunned and satisfied.”

Interpretation
Cesare Borgia was a master player in the game of power. Always planning
several moves ahead, he set his opponents the cleverest traps. For this
Machiavelli honored him above all others in The Prince.

LAW 20

Cesare foresaw the future with amazing clarity in Romagna‘. Only bru-
tal justice would bring order to the region. The process would take several
years, and at first the people would welcome it. But it would soon make
many enemies, and the citizens would come to resent the imposition of
such unforgiving justice, especially by outsiders. Cesare himself,
then,
could not be seen as the agent of this justice-—the people’s hatred would
cause too many problems in the future. And so he chose the one man who
could do the dirty work, knowing in advance that once the task was done
he would have to display de Orco’s head on a pike. The scapegoat in this
case had been planned from the beginning.

With Ts’ao Ts’ao, the scapegoat was an entirely innocent man; in the
Romagna, he was the offensive weapon in Cesare’s arsenal that let him get
the dirty work done without bloodying his own hands. With this second
kind of scapegoat it is wise to separate yourself from the hatchet man at
some point, either leaving him dangling in the wind or, like Cesare, even
making yourself the one to bring him to justice. Not only are you free of in-
volvement in the problem, you can appear as the one who cleaned it up.

The Golden Bough. Sirjames Gemge Frazer, 1854-19-71

KEYS TO POWER
The use of scapegoats is as old as civilization itself, and examples of it can
be found in cultures around the world. The main idea behind these sacri-
fices is the shifting of guilt and sin to an outside fig&#x27;ure—object, animal, or
man—which is then banished or destroyed. The Hebrews used to take a
live goat (hence the term “scapegoat”) upon whose head the priest would
lay both hands while confessing the sins of the Children of Israel. Having
thus had those sins transferred to it, the beast would be led away and aban-
doned in the wilderness. With the Athenians and the Aztecs, the scapegoat
was human, often a person fed and raised for the purpose. Since famine
and plague were thought to be visited on humans by the gods, in punish‘
ment for wrongdoing, the people suffered not only from the famine and
plague themselves but from blame and guilt. They freed themselves of guilt
by transferring it to an innocent person, whose death was intended to sat-
isfy the divine powers and banish the evil from their midst.

It is an extremely human response to not look inward after a mistake
or crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and guilt on a con-
venient object. When the plague was ravaging Thebes, Oedipus looked
everywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside himself and his own sin
of incest, which had so offended the gods and occasioned the plague. This
profound need to exteriorize one’s guilt, to project it on another person or
object, has an immense power, which the clever know how to harness. Sar-

LAW 26

203

rifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is a well-
spring of power. In the killing of de Orco, note Cesa.re’s symbolic and ritu-
alistic display of his body. By framing it in this dramatic way he focused
guilt outward The citizens of Romagna responded instantly. Because it
comes so naturally to us to look outward rather than inward, we readily ac~
cept the scapegoat’s guilt.

The bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems a barbaric relic of the
past, but the practice lives on to this day, if indirectly and symbolically;
since power depends on appearances, and those in power must seem never
to make mistakes, the use of scapegoats is as popular as ever. What modern
take responsibility for his blunders? He searches out others
leader will
to blame, a scapegoat to sacrifice. When Mao Tse-tung’s Cultural Rev—
olution failed miserably, he made no apologies or excuses to the Chinese
people; instead, like Ts’ao Ts’ao before him, he offered up scapegoats, in»
cluding his own personal secretary and higlrranking member of the Party,
Ch ’en Po-ta.

Franklin D. Roosevelt had a reputation for honesty and fairness.
Throughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which being
the nice guy would have spelled political d.isaster—yet he could not be
seen as the agent of any foul play. For twenty years, then, his secretary,
Louis Howe, played the role de Orco had. He handled the backroom deals,
the manipulation of the press, the underhandecl campaign maneuvers. And
whenever a mistake was committed, or a dirty trick contradicting Roo-
sevelt’s carefully crafted image became public, Howe served as the scape-
goat, and never complained.

Besides conveniently shifting blame, a scapegoat can serve as a warn-
ing to others. In 1631 a plot was hatched to oust France’s Cardinal Riche-
lieu from power, a plot that became known as “The Day of the Dupes.” It
almost succeeded, since it involved the upper echelons of government, in«
cluding the queen mother. But through luck and his own connivances,
Richelieu survived.

One of the key conspirators was a man named Marillac, the keeper of
the seals. Richelieu could not imprison him without implicating the queen
mother, an extremely dangerous tactic, so he targeted Marillac’s brother, a
marshal in the army. This man had no involvement in the plot. Richelieu,
however, afraid that other conspiracies might be in the air, especially in the
army, decided to set an example. He tried the brother on trurnped«up
charges and had him executed. In this way he indirectly punished the real
perpetrator, who had thought himself protected, and warned any future
conspirators that he would not shrink from sacrificing the innocent to pro-
tect his own power.

&#x27;

In fact it is often wise to choose the most innocent victim possible as a
sacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight you, and
their naive protests may be seen as protesting too much—may be seen, in
other words, as a sign of their guilt. Be careful, however, not to create a
martyr. It is important that ytm remain the victim, the poor leader betrayed

204

LAW 20‘

by the incompetence of those around you. If the scapegoat appears too
weak and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the victim of your
own device. Sometimes you should find a more powerful scapegoatm-one
who will elicit less sympathy in the long run.

In this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a
close associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the “fall of the favorite.”
Most kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom they singled out,
sometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with favors and attention.
But this court favorite could serve as at convenient scapegoat in case of a
threat to the king’s reputation. The public would readily believe in the
scapegoat’s guilt-—why would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were
guilty? And the other couxtiers, resendul of the favorite anyway, would re-
joice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile, would rid himself of a man who
by that time had probably learned too much about him, perhaps becoming
arrogant and even disdainful of him. Choosing a close associate as a scape-
goat has the same value as the “fall of the favorite.” You may lose a friend
or aide, but in the long—term scheme of things, it is more important to hide
your mistakes than to hold on to someone who one day will probably turn
against you. Besides, you can always find a. new favorite to take his place.

Image: The Innocent Goat. On
the Day of Atonement, the high
priest brings the goat into the
temple, places his hands on its
head, and confesses the pea»
ple’s sins, transferring guilt to
the guiltless beast, which is
then led to the wilderness and
the people’s sins
abandoned,
and blame vanishing with him.

Authority: Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in being
incapable of concealing it. All men make mistakes, but the wise
conceal the blunders they have made, while fools make them pub~
lic. Reputation depends more on what is hidden than on what is
seen. If you can’t be good, be careful. (Baltasar Grecian, 16014658)

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAVV I
In 59 B.C., the future queen Cleopatra of Egypt, then ten years old, wit~
nessed the overthrow and banishment of her father, Ptolemy XII, at the
hand of his elder daughters-«her own sisters. One of the daughters,
Berenice, emerged as the leader of the rebellion, and to ensure that she
would now rule Egypt alone, she imprisoned her other sisters and mur-
dered her own husband. This may have been necessary as a practical step
to secure her rule. But that a member of the royal family, a queen no less,
would so overtly exact such violence on her own family horrified her sub-
jects and stirred up powerful opposition. Four years later this opposition
was able to return Ptolemy to power, and he promptly had Berenice and
the other elder sisters beheaded.

In 51 B.C. Ptolemy died, leaving four remaining children as heirs. As
was the tradition in Egypt, the eldest son, Ptolemy XIII (only ten at the
time), married the elder sister, Cleopatra (now eighteen), and the couple
took the throne together as king and queen. None of the four children felt
satisfied with this; everyone, including Cleopatra, wanted more power. A
struggle emerged between Cleopatra and Ptolemy, earl: trying to push the
other to the side.

In 48 15.0., with the help of a government faction that feared Cleopa-
tra’s ambitions, Ptolemy was able to force his sister to flee the country,
leaving himself as sole ruler. In exile, Cleopatra schemed. She wanted to
rule alone and to restore Egypt to its past glory, a goal she felt none of her
other siblings could achieve; yet as long as they were alive, she could not
realize her dream. And the example of Berenice had made it clear that no
one would serve a queen who was seen murdering her own kind. Even
Ptolemy XIII had not dared murder Cleopatra, although he knew she
would plot against him from abroad.

Within a year after Cleopatra’s banishment, the Roman dictator Julius
Caesar arrived in Egypt, determined to make the country a Roman colony.
Cleopatra saw her chance: Reentering Egypt in disguise, she traveled hun-
dreds of miles to reach Caesar in Alexandria. Legend has it that she had

gracefully unfurled at his feet, revealing the young queen. Cleopatra imme
diately went to work on the Roman. She appealed to his love of spectacle
and his interest in Egyptian history, and poured on her feminine charms.
Caesar soon succumbed and restored Cleopatra to the throne.

Cleopatra’s siblings seethed—she had outrnaneuvered them. Ptolemy

XIII would not wait
Alexandria, he summoned a great army to march on the city and attack
Caesar. In response, Caesar immediately put Ptolemy and the rest of the
family under house arrest. But Cleopatra’s younger sister Arsinoe escaped
from the palace and placed herself at the head of the approaching Egyptian
troops, proclaiming herself queen of Egypt. Now Cleopatra finally saw her
chance: She convinced Caesar to release Ptolemy from house arrest, under
the agreement that he would broker a. truce. Of course she knew he would
do the opposite—that he would fight Arsinoe for control of the Egyptian
army. But this was to Cleopatra’s benefit, for it would divide the royal fam-
ily. Better still, it would give Caesar the chance to defeat and kill her sib-
lings in battle.

Reinforced by troops from Rome, Caesar swiftly defeated the rebels.
In the Egyptians’ retreat, Ptolemy drowned in the Nile. Caesar captured
Arsinoe and had her sent to Rome as a prisoner. He also executed the nu»
merous enemies who had conspired against Cleopatra, and imprisoned
others who had opposed her. To reinforce her position as uncontested
queen, Cleopatra now married the only sibling left, Ptolemy XIV—only
eleven at the time, and the weakest of the lot. Four years later Ptolemy
mysteriously died, of poison.

In 41 B.C., Cleopatra employed on a second Roman leader, Marc
Antony, the same tactics she had used so well on Julius Caesar. After se-
ducing him, she hinted to him that her sister Arsinoe, still a prisoner in
Rome, had conspired to destroy him. Marc Antony believed her and
promptly had Arsinoe executed, thereby getting rid of the last of the sib
lings who had posed such a threat to Cleopatra.

Interpretation
Legend has it that Cleopatra succeeded through her seductive charms, but
in reality her power came from an ability to get people to do her bidding
without realizing they were being manipulated. Caesar and Antony not
only rid her of her most dangerous siblings—Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe—
they decimated all of her enemies, in both the government and the mili-
tary. The two men became her cat’s—paws. They entered the fire for her,
did the ugly butnecessary work, while shielding her from appearing as the
destroyer of herlsiblings and fellow Egyptians. And in the end, both men
acquiesced to herldesire to rule Egypt not as a Roman colony but as an in-
dependent allied kingdom. And they did all this for her without realizing
how she had manipulated them. This was persuasion of the subtlest and
most powerful kind.

DBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11
In the late 1920s, civil war broke out in China as the Nationalist and Com
munist parties battled for control of the country. In 1927 Chiang Kai—shek,
the Nationalist leader, vowed to kill every last Communist, and over the
next few years he nearly accomplished his task, pushing his enemies hard
until, in 1934-1935, he forced them into the Long March, a six-thousand
mile retreat from the southeast to the remote northwest, through harsh ter-
rain, in which most of their ranks were decimated. In late 1936 Chiang
planned one last offensive to wipe them out, but he was caught in a mutiny:
His own soldiers captured him and turned him over to the Communists.
Now he could only expect the worst.

Meanwhile, however, the Japanese began an invasion of China, and
much to Chiang’s surprise, instead of killing him the Communist leader,
Mao Tse~tung, proposed a deal: The Communists would let him go, and
would recognize him as commander of their forces as well as his, if he
would agree to fight alongside them against their common enemy. Chiang
had expected torture and execution; now he could not believe his luck.
How soit these Reds had become. Without having to fight a rearguard ac-
tion against the Communists, he knew he could beat the Japanese, and
then a few years down the line he would turn around and destroy the Reds
with ease, He had nothing to lose and everything to gain by agreeing to
their terms.

The Communists proceeded to fight the Japanese in their usual fash~
ion, with hit»and-run guerrilla tactics, while the Nationalists fought a more
conventional war. Together, alter several years, they succeeded in evicting
the Japanese. Now, however, Chiang finally understood what Mao had re-
ally planned. His own army had met the bnmt of the Japanese artillery,
was greatly weakened, and would take a few years to recover. The Com~
munists, meanwhile, had not only avoided any direct hits from the japa~
nese, they had used the time to recoup their strength, and to spread out

Interpretation
Most leaders who had taken as powerful an enemy as Chiang Kai-shek
prisoner would have made sure to kill him. But in doing so they would
have lost the chance Mao exploited. Without the experienced Chiang as
leader of the Nationalists, the fight to drive the Japanese out might have
lasted much longer, with devastating results. Mao was far too clever to let
anger spoil the chance to kill two birds with one stone. In essence, Mao
used two cat’s-paws to help him attain total victory. First, he cleverly baited
Chiang into taking charge of the war against the Japanese. Mao knew the
Nationalists led by Chiang would do most of the hard fighting and would
succeed in pushing the Japanese out of China, if they did not have to con-
cern themselves with fighting the Communists at the same time. The Na-
tionalists, then, were the first cat’s—paw, used to evict the Japanese. But
Mao also knew that in the process of leading the war against the invaders,
the Japanese artillery and air support would decimate the conventional
forces of the Nationalists, doing damage it could take the Communists
decades to inflict. Why waste time and lives if the Japanese could do the
job quickly? It was this wise policy of using one cat’s—paw after another that
allowed the Communists to prevail.

There are two uses of the cat’s—paw: to save appearances, as Cleopatra
did, and to save energy and effort. The latter case in particular demands
that you plan several moves in advance, realizing that a temporary move
backward (letting Chiang go, say) can lead to a giant leap forward. If you
are temporarily weakened and need time to recover, it will often serve you
well to use those around you both as a screen to hide your intentions and
as a cat’s~paw to do your work for you. Look for a powerful third party who
shares an enemy with you (if for different reasons), then take advantage of
their superior power to deal blows which would have cost you much more
energy, since you are weaker. You can even gently guide them into hostili-
ties. Always search out the overly aggressive as potential cat’s-paws—they
are often more than willing to get into a fight, and you can choose just the
right fight for your purposes.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW III
Kuriyama Daizen was an adept of Cha-no—yu (Hot Water for Tea,
the
Japanese tea ceremony) and a student of the teachings of the great tea mas-
ter Sen no Rikyu. Around 1620 Daizen learned that a friend of his,
Hoshino Soemon, had borrowed a large sum of money (300 ryo) to help a

relative who had fallen into debt. But although Soemon had managed to
bail out his relative, he had simply displaced the burden onto himself.
Daizen knew Soemon well—-he neither cared not understood much about
money, and could easily get into trouble through slowness in repaying the
loan, which had been made by it wealthy merchant called Kawachiya
Sanemon. Yet if Daizen offered to help Soemon pay back the loam, he
would refuse, out of pride, and might even be offended.

One day Daizen visited his friend, and after touring the garden and
looking at Soemon’s prized peonies, they retired to his reception room.
Here Daizen saw a painting by the master Kano Tennyu. “Ah,” Daizen ex-
claimed, “a splendid piece of painting. . .
. I don’t know when I have seen
anything I like better.” After several more bouts of praise, Soemon had no
choice: “Well,” he said, “since you like it so much, I hope you will do me
the favor of accepting it.”

At first Daizen refused, but when Soemon insisted he gave in. The
next day Soemon in turn received a package from Daizen. Inside it was a
beautiful and delicate vase, which Daizen, in an accompanying note, asked
his friend to accept as a token of his appreciation for the painting that Soe~
mon had so graciously given him the day before. He explained that the
vase had been made by Sen no Rikyu himself, and bore an inscription
from Emperor Hideyoshi. If Soemon did not care for the vase, Daizen sug~
gested, he might make a gift of it to an adherent of Cha«no—yu—-perhaps
the merchant Kawachiya Sanemon, who had often expressed a desire to
possess it. “I hear,” Daizen continued, “he has a fine piece of fancy paper
[the 3()()~ryo I.O.U.] which you would much like. It is possible you might
arrange an exchange.”

Realizing what his gracious friend was up to, Soemon took the vase to
the wealthy lender. “However did you get this,” exclaimed Sanemon,
when Soemon showed him the vase. “I have often heard of it, but this is the
first time I have ever seen it. It is such a treasure that it is never allowed
outside the gate!” He instantly offered to exchange the debt note for the
flower vase, and to give Soemon 300 ryo more on top of it. But Socmon,
who did not care for money, only wanted the debt note back, and
Sanemon gladly gave it to him. Then Soemon immediately hunied to
Daizen’s house to thank him for his clever support

Interpretation
Kuriyama Daizen understood that the granting of a favor is never simple:
If it is done withfuss and obviousness, its receiver feels burdened by an
obligation. This may give the door a certain power, but it is a power that
will eventually self-destruct, for it will stir up resentment and resistance. A
favor done indirectly and elegantly has ten times more power. Daizen
knew a direct approach would only have offended Soemon. By letting his
friend give him the painting, however, he made Soemon feel that he too
had pleased his friend with a gift. In the end, all three parties emerged from
the encounter feeling fulfilled in their own way.

In essence, Daizen made himself the cat’s-paw, the tool to take the
chestnuts out of the fire. He must have felt some pain in losing the vase, but
he gained not only the painting but, more important, the power of the
courtier. The courtier uses his gloved hand to soften any blows against him,
disguise his scars, and make the act of rescue more elegant and clean. By
the courtier eventually helps himself. Daizen’s example
helping others,
provides the paradigm for every favor done between friends and peers:
never impose your favors. Search out ways to make yourself the cat’s—paw,
indirectly extricating your friends from distress without imposing yourself
or making them feel obligated to you.

KEYS TO POWER
As a leader you may imagine that constant diligence, and the appearance
of working harder than anyone else, signify power. Actually, though, they
have the opposite effect: They imply weakness. Why are you working so
hard? Perhaps you are incompetent, and have to put in extra effort just to
keep up; perhaps you are one of those people who does not know how to
delegate, and has to meddle in everything. The truly powerful, on the other
hand, seem never to be in a hurry or overburdened. While others work
their fingers to the bone, they take their leisure. They know how to find the
right people to put in the effort while they save their energy and keep their
hands out of the fire. Similarly, you may believe that by taking on the dirty
work yourself, involving yourself directly in unpleasant actions, you im-
pose your power and instill fear. In fact you make yourself look ugly, and
abusive of your high position. Truly powerful people keep their hands
clean. Only good things surround them, and the only announcements they
make are of glorious achievements.

You will often find it necessary, of course, to expend energy, or to ef
fact an evil but necessary action. But you must never appear to be this ac-
tion’s agent. Find 3. cat’s—paw. Develop the arts of finding, using, and, in
time, getting rid of these people when their cat’s-paw role has been ful-
filled.

On the eve of an important river battle, the great third—century Chi
nese strategist Chuko Liang found himself falsely accused of secretly work
ing for the other side. As proof of his loyalty, his commander ordered him
to produce 100,000 arrows for the army within three days, or be put to
death. Instead of trying to manufacture the arrows, an impossible task,
Liang took a dozen boats and had bundles of straw lashed to their sides. In
the late afternoon, when mist always blanketed the river, he floated the
boats toward the enemy camp. Fearing a trap from the wily Chuko Liang,
the enemy did not attack the barely visible boats with boats of their own,

but showered them with arrows from the bank. As Liang’s boats inched
closer, they redoubled the rain of arrows, which stuck in the thick straw.
After several hours, the men hiding on board sailed the vessels quickly
downstream, where Chuko Liang met them and collected his 100,000

arrows.

Chuko Liang would never do work that others could do for lu‘m—-he
was always thinking up tricks like this one. The key to planning such a
strategy is the ability to think far ahead, to imagine ways in which other
people can be baited into doing the job for you.

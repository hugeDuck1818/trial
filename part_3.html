they have had dire consequences, especially in dealings with the Castruc
cios of the world. Stefano knew that the prince had risen to power through
treachery and ruthlessness. This was a man, after all, who had put a close
and devoted friend to death. When Castruccio was told that it had been a
terrible wrong to kill such an old friend, he replied that he had executed
not an old friend but a new enemy.

A man like Castruccio knows only force and self—interest. When the re-
bellion began, to end it and place oneself at his mercy was the most dan—
gerous possible move. Even once Stefano di Poggio had made that fatal
mistake, however, he still had options: He could have offered money to
Castruccio, could have made promises for the future, could have pointed
out what the Poggios could still contribute to Castruccio’s power-their in-
fluence with the most influential families of Rome, for example, and the
great marriage they could have brokered.

Instead Stefano brought up the past, and debts that carried no obliga-
tion. Not only is a man not obliged to be grateful, gratitude is often a terri-
ble burden that he gladly discards. And in this case Castruccio rid himself
of his obligations to the Poggios by eliminating the Poggios.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 4-33 B.C., just before the Peloponnesian War, the island of Corcyra (later
called Corfu) and the Greek city~state of Corinth stood on the brink of con-
flict. Both parties sent ambassadors to Athens to try to win over the Atheni~
ans to their side. The stakes were high, since whoever had Athens on his
side was sure to win. And whoever won the war would certainly give the
defeated side no mercy.

Corcyra spoke first. Its ambassador began by admitting that the island
had never helped Athens before, and in fact had allied itself with Athens’s
enemies. There were no ties of friendship or gratitude between Corcyra
and Athens. Yes, the ambassador achnitted, he had come to Athens now
out of fear and concern for Corcyra’s safety. The only thing he could offer
was an alliance of mutual interests. Corcyra had a navy only surpassed in
size and strength by Athens’s own; an alliance between the two states
would create a formidable force, one that could intimidate the rival state of
Sparta. That, unfortunately, was all Oorcyra had to offer.

The representative from Corinth then gave a brilliant, passionate
speech, in sharp contrast to the dry, colorless approach of the Corcyran.
He talked of everything Corinth had done for Athens in the past. He asked
how it would look to Athens’s other allies if the city put an agreement with
a former enemy over one with a present friend, one that had served
Athens’s interest loyally: Perhaps those allies would break their agreements
with Athens if they saw that their loyalty was not valued. He referred to
Hellenic law, and the need to repay Corinth for all its good deeds. He fi-
nally went on to list the many services Corinth had performed for Athens,
and the importance of showing gratitude to one’s friends.

After the speech, the Athenians debated the issue in an assembly. On

LAW I3

97

the second round, they voted overwhelmingly to ally with Corcyra and
drop Corinth.

Interpretation
History has remembered the Athenians nobly, but they were the preemi-
nent realists of classical Greece. With them, all the rhetoric, all the emo-
tional appeals in the world, could not match a good pragmatic argument,
especially one that added to their power.

What the Corinthian ambassador did not realize was that his refer-
ences to Corinth’s past generosity to Athens only irritated the Athenians,
subtly asking them to feel guilty and putting them under obligation. The
Athenians couldn’t care less about past favors and friendly feelings. At the
same time, they knew that if their other allies thought them ungrateful for
abandoning Corinth, these city-states would still be unlikely to break their
ties to Athens, the preeminent power in Greece. Athens ruled its empire by
force, and would simply compel any rebellious ally to return to the fold.

When people choose between talk about the past and talk about the
future, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget the past.
As the Corcyrans realized, it is always best to speak pragmatically to a
pragmatic person. And in the end, most people are in fast pragmatic-—they
will rarely act against their own self-interest.

It has always been a rule that the weak should be subject to the strong;
and besides, we consider that we am worthy of our power. Up till the
present moment you, too, used to think that we were; but now. after
calculating your own interest, you are beginning to talk in terms of right
and wrong. Conréderatiores ofthis kind have never yet turned people aside

KEYS TO POWER
In your quest for power, you will constantly find yourself in the position of
asking for help from those more powerful than you. There is an art to ask-
ing for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person
you are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs.

Most people never succeed at

this, because they are completely
trapped in their own wants and desires. They start from the assumption
that the people they are appealing to have a selfless interest in helping
them. They talk as if their needs mattered to these peopleowho probably
couldn’t care less. Sometimes they refer to larger issues: a great cause, or
grand emotions such as love and gratitude. They go for the big picture
when simple, everyday realities would have much more appeal. What they
do not realize is that even the most powerful person is locked inside needs
of his own, and that if you make no appeal to his selfdnterest, he merely
sees you as desperate or, at best, a waste of time.

In the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries tried for years to con
vert the people ofjapan to Catholicism, while at the same time Portugal
had a monopoly on trade between japan and Europe. Although the mis-
sionaries did have some success, they never got far among the ruling elite;
by the beginning of the seventeenth century, in fact, their proselytizing had
completely antagonized the Japanese emperor Ieyasu. When the Dutch
began to arrive in japan in great numbers, Ieyasu was much relieved. He
needed Europeans for their know-how in guns and navigation, and here at
last were Europeans who cared nothing for spreading religion——the Dutch
wanted only to trade. Ieyasu swiftly moved to evict the Portuguese. From
then on, he would only deal with the practicalminded Dutch.

Japan and Holland were vastly different cultures, but each shared a
timeless and universal concern: selfiinterest. Every person you deal with is
like another culuire, an alien land with a past that has nothing to do with
yours. Yet you can bypass the differences between you and him by appeal-
ing to his self—interest. Do not be subtle: You have valuable knowledge to
share, you will fill his coffers with gold, you will make him live longer and
happier. This is a language that all of us speak and understand.

A key step in the process is to understand the other person’s psychol~
ogy. Is he vain? Is he concerned about his reputation or his social standing?
Does he have enemies you could help him vanquish? Is he simply mod»
vated by money and power?

When the Mongols invaded China in the twelfth century, they threab
erred to obliterate a culture that had thrived for over two thousand years.
Their leader, Genghis Khan, saw nothing in China. but a country that
lacked pasturing for his horses, and he decided to destroy the place, IeveI~
ing all its cities, for “it would be better to exterminate the Chinese and let
the grass grow.” It was not a soldier, a. general, or a king who saved the
Chinese from devastation, but a man named Yelu Ch’u—Ts’ai. A foreigner
himself, Ch’u«Ts’ai had come to appreciate the superiority of Chinese cul-
ture. He managed to make himself a trusted adviser to Genghis Khan, and
persuaded him that he would reap riches out of the place if, instead of de
straying it, he simply taxed everyone who lived there. Khan saw the wis-
dom in this and did as Ch’u—Ts‘a.i advised.

When Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and decided to
massaxtre its inhabitants (as he had in other cities that had resisted him),
Ch’u~Ts’ai told him that the finest craftsmen and engineers in China had
fled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put them to use. Kaifeng was
spared. Never before had Genghis Khan shown such mercy, but then it
really wasn’t mercy that saved Kaifeng. Ch‘u—Ts’ai knew Khan well. He was
a barbaric peasant who cared nothing for culuire, or indeed for anything
other than warfare and practical results. Ch’u—Ts’ai chose to appeal to the
only emotion that would work on such a man: greed.

Self-interest is the lever that will move people. Once you make them
see how you can in some way meet their needs or advance their cause,
their resistance to your requests for help will magically fall away. At each
step on the way to acquiring power, you must train yourself to think your

REVERSAI.
Some people will see an appeal to their selfiinterest as ugly and ignoble.
They actually prefer to be able to exercise charity, mercy, and justice,
which are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg them for
help, you emphasize their power and position. They are strong enough to
need nothing from you except the chance to feel superior. This is the wine
that intoxicates them. They are dying to fund your project, to introduce
you to powerful people———provided, of course, that all this is done in public,
and for a good cause (usually the more public, the better). Not everyone,
then, can be approached through cynical self—interest. Some people will be
put off by it, because they dorft want to seem to be motivated by such
things. They need opportunities to display their good heart,

Do not be shy. Give them that opportunity. It’s not as if you are con»
ning them by asking for help——it is really their pleasure to give, and to be
seen giving. You must distinguish the differences among powerful people
and figure out what makes them tick. When they ooze greed, do not appeal
to their charity. When they want to look charitable and noble, do not ap-
peal to their greed.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Joseph Duveen was undoubtedly the greatest art dealer of his time—from
1904 to 194-0 he almost single—handedly rnonopolized America’s million-
aire art-collecting market. But one prize plum eluded him: the industrialist
Andrew Mellon. Before he died, Duveen was determined to make Mellon
a client.

Duveen’s friends said this was an impossible dreani. Mellon was a stiff,
taciturn man. The stories he had heard about the congenial, talkative Du-
veen rubbed him the wrong way—-he had made it clear he had no desire to
meet the man. Yet Duveen told his doubting friends, “Not only will Mellon
buy from me but he will buy only from me.” For several years he tracked
his prey, learning the man’s habits, tastes, phobias. To do this, he secretly
put several of Mellon’s staff on his own payroll, worming valuable informa-
tion out of them. By the time he moved into action, he knew Mellon about
as well as Mellon’s wife did.

In 1921 Mellon was visiting London, and staying in a palatial suite on
the third floor of Claridge’s Hotel. Duveen booked himself into the suite
just below Mellon’s, on the second floor. He had arranged for his valet to
befriend Mellon’s valet, and on the fateful day he had chosen to make his
move, Mellon’s valet told Duveen’s valet, who told Duveen, that he had
just helped Mellon on with his overcoat, and that the industrialist was mak-
ing his way down the corridor to ring for the lift.

Duveen’s valet hurriedly helped Duveen with his own overcoat. Sec»
onds later, Duveen entered the lift, and lo and behold, there was Mellon.
“How do you do, Mr. Mellon?” said Duveen, introducing himself. “I am on
my way to the National Gallery to look at some pictures.” How uncanny-
that was precisely where Mellon was headed. And so Duveen was able to
accompany his prey to the one location that would ensure his success. He
knew Mellon’s taste inside and out, and while the two men wandered
through the museum, he dazzled the magnate with his knowledge. Once
again quite uncannily, they seemed to have remarkably similar tastes.

Mellon was pleasantly surprised: This was not the Duveen he had ex-
pected. The man was charming and agreeable, and clearly had exquisite
taste. When they returned to New York, Mellon visited Duveen’s exclusive
gallery and fell in love with the collection. Everything, surprisingly enough,
seemed to be precisely the kind of work he wanted to collect. For the rest
of his life he was Duveen’s best and most generous client.

Interpretation
A man as ambitious and competitive as Joseph Duveen left nothing to
chance. What’s the point of winging ig of just hoping you may be able to
charm this or that client? It’s like shooting ducks blindfolded. Arm yourself
with a little knowledge and your aim improves.

Mellon was the most spectacular of Duveen’s catches, but he spied on
many a millionaire. By secretly putting members of his clients’ household
staffs on his own payroll, he would gain constant access to valuable infor-

I02

LAW 14

mation about their masters’ comings and goings, changes in taste, and
other such tidbits of information that would put him a step ahead. A rival
of Duveen’s who wanted to make Henry Frick a client noticed that when-
ever he visited this wealthy New Yorker, Duveen was there before him, as
if he had a sixth sense. To other dealers Duveen seemed to be everywhere,
and to know everything before they did. His powers discouraged and dis-
heartened them, until many simply gave up going after the wealthy clients
who could make a dealer rich.

Such is the power of artful spying: It makes you seem all—powerful,
clairvoyant. Your knowledge of your mark can also make you seem charm-
ing, so well can you anticipate his desires. No one sees the source of your
power, and what they cannot see they cannot fight.

Rulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Bmhmins through
scriptures and the rest of the people through their normal eyes.
Kantily/1, Indian philmoplm; third amtury 3.1:.

KEYS TO POWER
In the realm of power, your goal is a degree of control over future events.
Part of the problem you face, then, is that people won’t tell you all their
thoughts, emotions, and plans. Controlling what they say, they often keep
the most critical parts of their character hidden—their weaknesses, ulterior
motives, obsessions. The result is that you cannot predict their moves, and
are constantly in the dark. The trick is to find a way to probe them, to find
out their secrets and hidden intentions, without letting them know what
you are up to.

This is not as difficult as you might think. A friendly front will let you
secretly gather information on friends and enemies alike. Let others con-
sult the horoscope, or read tarot cards: You have more concrete means of
seeing into the future.

The most common way of spying is to use other people, as Duveen
did. The method is simple, powerful, but risky: You will certainly gather in-
formation, but you have little control over the people who are doing the
work. Perhaps they will ineptly reveal your spying, or even secretly turn
against you. It is far better to be the spy yourself, to pose as a friend while
secretly gathering information.

The French politician Talleyrand was one of the greatest practitioners
of this art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out of people in pa-
lite conversation. A contemporary of his, Baron de Vitrolles, wrote, “Wit
and grace marked his conversation. He possessed the art of concealing his
thoughts or his malice beneath a transparent veil of insinuations, words
that imply something more than they express. Only when necessary did he
inject his own personality.” The key here is Talleyrand’s ability to suppress
himself in the conversation, to make others talk endlessly about themselves
and inadvertently reveal their intentions and plans.

LAW 14

103

Throughout Talleyrand’s life, people said he was a superb conversa-
tionalist—yet he actually said very little. He never talked about his own
ideas; he got others to reveal theirs. He would organize friendly games of
charades for foreign diplomats, social gatherings where, however, he
would carefully weigh their words, cajole confidences out of them, and
gather information invaluable to his work as France’s foreign minister. At
the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) he did his spying in other ways: He
would blurt out what seemed to be a secret (actually something he had
made up), then watch his listeners’ reactions. He might tell a gathering of
diplomats, for instance, that a reliable source had revealed to him that the
czar of Russia was planning to arrest his top general for treason. By watch-
ing the diplomats’ reactions to this madealp story, he would know which
ones were most excited by the weakening of the Russian army—~perhaps
their goverments had designs on Russia? As Baron Von Stetten said,
“Monsieur Talleyrand fires a pistol into the air to see who will jump out the
window.”

During social gatherings and innocuous encounters, pay attention.
This is when people’s guards are down. By suppressing your own personal-
ity, you can make them reveal things. The brilliance of the maneuver is
that they will mistake your interest in them for friendship, so that you not
only learn, you malce allies.

Nevertheless, you should practice this tactic with caution and care. If
people begin to suspect you are worming secrets out of them under the
they will strictly avoid you. Emphasize friendly
cover of conversation,
chatter, not valuable information. Your search for gems of information can-
not be too obvious, or your probing questions will reveal more about your
self and your intentions than about the information you hope to find.

A trick to try in spying comes from La Rochefoucauld, who wrote,
“Sincerity is found in very few men, and is often the cleverest of ruses——
one is sincere in order to draw out the confidence and secrets of the other.”
By pretending to bare your heart to another person, in other words, you
make them more likely to reveal their own secrets. Give them a false con‘
fession and they will give you a real one. Another trick was identified by
the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who suggested vehemently contra-
dicting people you’re in conversation with as a way of irritating them, stir—
ring them up so that they lose some of the control over their words. In their
emotional reaction they will reveal all kinds of truths about themselves,
truths you can later use against them.

Another method of indirect spying is to test people, to lay little traps
that make them reveal things about themselves. Chosroes II, a notoriously
clever seventlrcentury king of the Persians, had many ways of seeing
through his subjects without raising suspicion. If he noticed, for instance,
that two of his couruers had become particularly friendly, he would call
one of them aside and say he had information that the other was a traitor,
and would soon be killed. The king would tell the courtier he tmsted him
more than anyone, and that he must keep this information secret. Then he

would watch the two men carefully. If he saw that the second courtier had
not changed in his behavior toward the king, he would conclude that the
first courtier had kept the secret, and he would quickly promote the man,
later taking him aside to confess, “I meant to kill your friend because of
certain information that had reached me, but, when I investigated the mat-
ter, I found it was untrue.” If, on the other hand, the second courtier started
to avoid the king, acting aloof and tense, Chosroes would know that the se
cret had been revealed. He would ban the second courtier from his court,
letting him know that the whole business had only been a test, but that
even though the man had done nothing wrong, he could no longer trust
him. The first courtier, however, had revealed a secret, and him Chosroes
would ban from his entire kingdom.

It may seem an odd form of spying that reveals not empirical informa:
tion but a person’s character. Often, however, it is the best way of solving
problems before they arise.

By tempting people into certain acts, you learn about their loyalty,
their honesty, and so on. And this kind of knowledge is often the most
valuable of all: Armed with it, you can predict their actions in the future.

Information is critical to power, but just as you spy on other people, you
must be prepared for them to spy on you. One of the most potent weapons
in the battle for information, then, is giving out false information. As Mn-
ston Churchill said, “Truth is so precious that she should always be at»
tended by a bodyguard of lies.” You must surround yourself with such a
bodyguard, so that your truth cannot be penetrated. By planting the infor-
mation of your choice, you control the game.

In 1944 the Nazis’ rocket-bomb attacks on London suddenly escalated.
Over two thousand V-1 flying bombs fell on the city, killing more than five
thousand people and wounding many more, Somehow, however, the Ger-
mans consistently missed their targets. Bombs that were intended for
Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall well short of the city, landing in the
less populated suburbs. This was because, in fixing their targets, the Ger-
mans relied on secret agents they had planted in England. They did not
know that these agents had been discovered, and that in their place,
English—c0ntrolled agents were feeding them subtly deceptive information.
The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time
they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows in the
country. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a potent ad
vantage. While spying gives you a third eye, disinformation puts out one of
your enemy’s eyes. A cyclops, he always misses his target.

&#x27;1‘RANSGRESS[Ol\&#x27; OF THE LAW
No rivalry between leaders is more celebrated in Chinese history than the
struggle between Hsiang Yu and Liu Pang. These two generals began their
careers as friends, fighting on the same side. Hsiang Yu came from the no-
bility; large and powerful, given to bouts of violence and temper, a bit dull-
witted, he was yet a mighty warrior who always fought at the head of his
troops. Liu Pang came from peasant stock. He had never been much of a
soldier, and preferred women and wine to fighting; in fact, he was some
thing of a scoundrel. But he was wily, and he had the ability to recognize
the best strategists, keep them as his advisers, and listen to their advice. He
had risen in the army through these strengths.

In 208 13.0., the king of Ch’u sent two massive armies to conquer the
powerful kingdom of Ch’in. One army went north, under the generalship
of Sung Yi, with Hsiang Yu second in command; the other, led by Liu
Pang, headed straight toward Ch’in. The target was the kingdom’s splendid
capital, Hsien-yang. And Hsiang Yu, ever violent and impatient, could not
stand the idea that Liu Pang would get to Hsietryang first, and perhaps
would assume command of the entire anny.

At one point on the northern front, Hsiang’s commander, Sung Yi,
hesitated in sending his troops into battle. Furious, Hsiang entered Sung
Yi’s tent, proclaimed him a traitor, cut off his head, and assumed sole com~
mand of the army. Without waiting for orders, he left the northern front
and marched directly on Hsien—yang. He felt certain he was the better sol-
dier and general than Liu, but, to his utter astonishment, his rival, leading a
smaller, swifter army, managed to reach Hsien-yang first. Hsiang had an
adviser, Fan Tseng, who warned him, “This village headman [Liu Fang]
used to be greedy only for riches and women, but since entering the capital
he has not been led astray by wealth, wine, or sex. That shows he is aiming
high.”

Fan Tseng urged Hsiang to kill his rival before it was too late. He told
the general to invite the wily peasant to a banquet at their camp outside
Hsien-yang, and, in the midst of a celebratory sword dance, to have his
head out off. The invitation was sent; Liu fell for the trap, and came to the
banquet. But I-Isiang hesitated in ordering the sword dance, and by the
time he gave the signal, Liu had sensed a trap, and managed to escape.
“Bah!” cried Fan Tseng in disgust, seeing that Hsiang had botched the plot.
“One cannot plan with 3. simpleton. Liu Pang will steal your empire yet
and make us all his prisoners.&quot;

Realizing his mistake, Hsiang hurriedly marched on Hsien-yang, this
time determined to hack off his rival’s head. Liu was never one to fight
when the odds were against him, and he abandoned the city. Hsiang cap~
tured Hsien-yang, murdered the young prince of Ch’in, and burned the
city to the ground. Liu was now Hsiang’s bitter enemy, and he pursued
him for many months, finally cornering him in a walled city. Lacking food,
his army in disarray, Liu sued for peace.

Again Fan Tseng wamed Hsiang, “Crush him now! If you let him go

again, you will be sorry later.” But Hsiang decided to be merciful. He
wanted to bring Liu back to Ch’u alive, and to force his former friend to ac-
knowledge him as master. But Fan proved right: Liu managed to use the
negotiations for his surrender as a distraction, and he escaped with a small
army. Hsiang, amazed that he had yet again let his rival slip away, once
more set out after Liu, this time with such ferocity that he seemed to have
lost his mind. At one point, having captured Liu’s father in battle, Hsiang
stood the old man up during the fighting and yelled to Liu across the line of
troops, “Surrender now, or I shall boil your father alive!” Liu calmly arr
swered, “But we are sworn brothers. So my father is your father also. If you
insist on boiling your own father, send me a bowl of the soup!” Hsiang
backed down, and the struggle continued.

A few weeks later, in the thick of the hunt, Hsiang scattered his forces
unwisely, and in a surprise attack Liu was able to surround his main garri-
son. For the first time the tables were turned. Now it was Hsiang who sued
for peace. Liu’s top adviser urged him to destroy Hsiang, crush his army,
show no mercy. “To let him go would be like rearing a tiger——it will devour
you later,” the adviser said. Liu agreed.

Making a false treaty, he lured Hsiarig into relaxing his defense, then
slaughtered almost all of his army. Hsiang managed to escape. Alone and
on foot, knowing that Liu had put a bounty on his head, he came upon a
small group of his own retreating soldiers, and cried out, “I hear Liu Pang
has offered one thousand pieces of gold and a fief of ten thousand families
for my head. Let me do you a favor.” Then he slit his own throat and died.

Interpretation
Hsiang Yu had proven his ruthlessness on many an occasion. He rarely
hesitated in doing away with a rival if it served his purposes. But with Liu
Pang he acted differently. He respected his rival, and did not want to defeat
him through deception; he wanted to prove his superiority on the battle
field, even to force the clever Liu to surrender and to serve him. Every time
he had his rival in his hands, something made him hesitat&amp;——a fatal sympa~
thy with or respect for the man who, after all, had once been a friend and
comrade in arms. But the moment Hsiang made it clear that he intended to
do away with Liu, yet failed to accomplish it, he sealed his own doom. Liu
would not suffer the same hesitation once the tables were tamed.

This is the fate that faces all of us when we sympathize with our ene
mics, when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back from
doing away with them. We only strengthen their fear and hatred of us. We
have beaten them, and they are humiliated; yet we nurture these resentful
vipers who will one day kill us. Power cannot be dealt with this way. It
must be exterrninated, crushed, and denied the chance to return to haunt
us. This is all the truer with a former friend who has become an enemy.
The law governing fatal antagonisnis reads: Reconciliation is out of the
question. Only one side can win, and it must win totally.

Liu Pang learned this lesson well. After defeating Hsiang Yu, this son

Crushing his next n&#x27;val—the king of Ch’u, his own former leader—l1e
crowned himself emperor, defeated everyone in his path, and went down

Those who seek to achieve things should Show no mercy.
Kuutilyu, Indian plzilnsupher, zhml century 11. (I.

OBSERVANCE OF ‘THE LAW
Wu Chan, born in Ad). 625, was the daughter of a duke, and as a. beautiful
young woman of many charms, she was accordingly attached to the harem
of Emperor T’a.i Tsung.

The imperial harem was a dangerous place, full of young concubines
vying to become the emperor’s favorite. Wu’s beauty and forceful charac-
ter quickly won her this battle, but, knowing that an emperor, like other
powerful men, is a creature of whim, and that she could easily be replaced,
she kept her eye on the future.

Wu managed to seduce the emperor’s dissolute son, Kao Tsung, on the
only possible occasion when she could find him alone: while he was reliev-
ing himself at the royal urinal. Even so, when the emperor died and Ken
Tsung took over the throne, she still suffered the fate to which all wives and
concubines of a deceased emperor were bound by tradition and law: Her
head shaven, she entered a convent, for what was supposed to be the rest
of her life. For seven years Wu schemed to escape. By communicating in
secret with the new emperor, and by befiiencling his wife, the empress, she
managed to get a highly unusual royal edict allowing her to return to the
palace and to the royal harem. Once there, she fawned on the empress,
while still sleeping with the emperor. The empress did not discourage
this—--she had yet to provide the emperor with an heir, her position was
vulnerable, and Wu was a valuable ally.

In 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came to
visit, and as soon as she had left, Wu smothered the newborn——her own
baby. When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately fell on the
empress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and whose jealous
nature was known by all. This was precisely Wu’s plan. Shortly thereafter,
the empress was charged with murder and executed. Wu Chao was
crowned empress in her place. Her new husband, addicted to his life of
pleasure, gladly gave up the reins of government to Wu Chao, who was
from then on known as Empress Wu.

Although now in a position of great power, Wu hardly felt secure.
There were enemies everywhere; she could not let down her guard for one
moment. Indeed, when she was forty-one, she began to fear that her bean~
tiful young niece was becoming the emperor’s favorite. She poisoned the
woman with a clay mixed into her food. In 675 her own son, touted as the

heir apparent, was poisoned as well. The next—eldest son———illegil:&#x27;ma.te, but
now the crown prince——was exiled a little later on trumped—up charges.
And when the emperor died, in 683, Wu managed to have the son after
that declared unfit for the throne. All flris meant that it was her youngest,
most ineffectual son who finally ‘became emperor. In this way she contin-
ued to rule.

Over the next five years there were innumerable palace coups. All of
them failed, and all of the conspirators were executed. By 688 there was no
one left to challenge Wu. She proclaimed herself a divine descendant of
Buddha, and in 690 her wishes were finally granted: She was named Holy
and Divine “Emperor” of China.

Wu became emperor because there was literally nobody le-R from the
previous &quot;Pang dynasty. And so she ruled unchallenged, for over a decade
of relative peace. In 705, at the age of eighty, she was forced to abdicate.

Interpretation
All who knew Empress Wu remarked on her energy and intelligence. At
the time, there was no glory available for an ambitious woman beyond a
few years in the imperial harem, then a lifetime walled up in a convent. In
Wu’s gradual but remarkable rise to the top, she was never naive. She
knew that any hesitation, any momentary weakness, would spell her and.
If, every time she got rid of a rival a new one appeared, the solution was
simple: She had to crush them all or be killed herself. Other emperors be
fore her had followed the same path to the top, but Wu-«who, as a woman,
had next to no chance to gain power———had to be more ruthless still.

Empress Wu’s forly—year reign was one of the longest in Chinese his-
tory. Although the story of her bloody rise to power is well known, in
China she is considered one of the period’s most able and effective rulers.

A priest asked the dying Spanish statesman and general Ramon Maria Narvdez

(1800-1868),

“Does your Excellency forgive all your enemies?” “I do not

have to forgive my ene1nies,&quot;anrwmed Narmiez, “I have had them all shat. ”

KEYS TO POWER
It is no accident that the two stories illustrating this law come from China:
Chinese history abounds with examples of enemies who were left alive and
returned to haunt the lenient. “Crush the enemy” is a key strategic tenet of
Surrtzu, the fourth—century—B.C. author of The Art ofl/Wzr. The idea is simple:
Your enemies wish you ill. There is nothing they want more than to elimi-
nate you. If, in your struggles with them, you stop halfway or even three
quarters of the way, out of mercy or hope of reconciliation, you only make
them more determined, more embittered, and they will someday take re-
venge. They may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because
you have defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time.

The solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as they

LAW 15

I71

would crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for
from your enemies is their disappearance.

Mao Tse—tung, a devoted reader of Sun—tzu and of Chinese history gexr
erally, knew the importance of this law. In i934 the Communist leader and
some 75,000 poorly equipped soldiers fled into the desolate mountains of
western China to escape Chiang K.ai—shek’s much larger army, in what has
since been called the Long March.

Chiang was determined to eliminate every last Communist, and by a
few years later Mao had less than 10,000 soldiers left. By 1937, in fact,
when China was invaded by japan, Chiang calculated that the Commu-
nists were no longer a threat. He chose to give up the chase and conceir
trate on the Japanese. Ten years later the Communists had recovered
enough to rout Chia.ng’s army. Chiang had forgotten the ancient wisdom of
crushing the enemy; Mao had not. Chiang was pursued until he and his en-
tire army fled to the island of Taiwan. Nothing remains of his regime in
mainland China to this day.

The wisdom behind “crushing the enemy” is as ancient as the Bible:
Its first practitioner may have been Moses, who learned it from God Him«
self, when He parted the Red Sea for the Jews, then let the water {low back
over the pursuing Egyptians so that “not so much as one of them re-
mained.” When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with the Ten Corn-
mandments and found his people worshipping the Golden Calf, he had
every last offender slaughtered. And just before he died, he told his follow-
ers, finally about to enter the Promised Land, that when they had defeated
the tribes of Canaan they should “utterly destroy them .
. make no
covenant with them, and show no mercy to them.”

.

.

The goal of total victory is an axiom of modern warfare, and was codi-
fied as such by Carl von Clausewitz, the premier philosopher of war. Ana»
lyzing the campaigns of Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote, “We do claim
that direct annihilation of the enemy’s forces must always be the dominant
. Once a major victory is achieved there must be no talk of
consideration. .
. but only of the pursuit, going for the enemy
rest, of breathing space .
again, seizing his capital, attacking his reserves and anything else that
might give his country aid and comfort.” The reason for this is that afier
war some negotiation and the division of territory. If you have only won a
inevitably lose in negotiation what you have
partial victory, you will
gained by war.

.

The solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options. Annihilate
them and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power is to control
your enemies completely, to make them obey your will. You cannot afford
to go halfway. If they have no options, they will be forced to do your bid-
ding. This law has applications far beyond the battlefield. Negotiation is the
insidious viper that will eat away at your victory, so give your enemies
nothing to negotiate, no hope, no room to maneuver. They are crushed
and that is that.

Realize this: In your struggle for power you will stir up rivalries and

I12

LAW 15

create enemies. There will be people you cannot win over, who will re~
main your enemies no matter what. But whatever wound you inflicted on
them, deliberately or not, do not take their hatred personally. just recog»
nize that there is no possibility of peace between you, especially as long as
you stay in power. If you let them stick around, they will seek revenge, as
certainly as night follows day. To wait for them to show their cards is just
silly; as Empress Wu understood, by then it will be too late.

Be realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be secure.
Remember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses and Mao:
Never go halfway.

It is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of banishment.
Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court forever, your ene-
mies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of recovering, insinuating
themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot be banished, at least un-
derstand that they are plotting against you, and pay no heed to whatever
friendliness they feign. Your only weapon in such a situation is your own
war-iness. If you cannot banish them immediately, then plot for the best
time to act.

Image: A Viper crushed
beneath your foot but left
alive, will rear up and bite
you with a double dose of
venom. An enemy that
is
left around is like a half-
deacl viper that you nurse
back to health. Time makes
the venom grow stronger.

Authority: For it must be
noted, that men must either be
caressed or else annihilated;
they will revenge themselves
for small
injuries, but cannot
do so for great ones; the injury
therefore that we do to a man

must be such that we need not
fear his vengeance. {Niccolo
Machiavelli, 1469-1527}

LAW 15

;

113

RE VE RSAL
This law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes happen that
it is better to let your enemies destroy themselves, if such a thing is possi-
ble, than to make them suffer by your hand. In warfare, for example, a
good general knows that if he attacks an army when it is cornered, its sol-
diers will fight much more fiercely. It is sometimes better, then, to leave
them an escape route, a way out As they retreat, they wear themselves out,
and are ultimately more demoralized by the retreat than by any defeat he
might inflict on the battlefield. When you have someone on the ropes,
then——-but only when you are sure they have no chance of recovery--you
might let them hang themselves. Let them be the agents of their own de-
struction. The result will be the same, and you won‘t feel half as bad.

Finally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so much
that they spend years and years plotting revenge. The Treaty of Versailles
had such an effect on the Germans. Some would argue that in the long run
it would be better to show some leniency. The problem is, your leniency
involves another n&#x27;sk—it may embolden the enemy, which still harbors a
&quot; grudge, but now has some room to operate. It is almost always wiser to
crush your enemy. If they plot revenge years later, do not let your guard
down, but simply crush them again.

TRANSGRESSION AND OBSPLRVANCE OF THE LAW

Sir Guillaume de Balaun was a troubadour who roamed the South of
France in the Middle Ages, going from castle to castle, reciting poetry, and
playing the perfect knight. At the castle of javiac he met and fell in love
with the beautiful lady of the house, Madame Guillelma dejaviac. He sang
her his songs, recited his poetry, played chess with her, and little by little
she in turn fell in love with him. Guillaume had a friend, Sir Pierre de Bar
jac, who traveled with him and who was also received at the castle. And
Pierre too fell in love with a lady in javiac, the gracious but temperamental
Viemetta.

Then one day Pierre and Viernetta had a violent quarrel. The lady
dismissed him, and he sought out his friend Guillaume to help heal the
breach and get him back in her good graces. Guillaume was about to leave
the castle for a while, but on his return, several weeks later, he worked his
magic, and Pierre and the lady were reconciled. Pierre felt that his love
had increased tenfold—that there was no stronger love, in fact, than the
love that follows reconciliation. The stronger and longer the disagreement,
he told Guillaume, the sweeter the feeling that comes with peace and
rapprochement,

As a troubadour, Sir Guillaume prided himself on experiencing all the
joys and sorrows of love. On hearing his friend&#x27;s talk, he too wanted know
the bliss of reconciliation after a quarrel. He therefore feigned great anger
with Lady Guillelma, stopped sending her love letters. and abruptly left the
castle and stayed away, even during the festivals and hunts. This drove the
young lady wild.

Guillelma sent messengers to Guillaume to find out what bad hair»
pened, but he turned the messengers away. He thought all this would make
her angry, forcing him to plead for reconciliation as Pierre had. Instead,
however, his absence had the opposite effect: It made Guillelma love him
all the more. Now the lady pursued her knight, sending messengers and
love notes of her own. This was almost unheard of-—-a lady never pursued
her troubadour. And Guillaume did not like it. Guillelma’s forwardness
made him feel she had lost some of her dignity. Not only was he no longer
sure of his plan, he was no longer sure of his lady.

Finally, after several months of not hearing from Guillaume, Guillelma
gave up. She sent him no more messengers, and he began to wonder-per-
haps she was angry? Perhaps the plan had worked after all? So much the
better if she was. He would wait no more.-it was time to reconcile. So he
put on his best robe, decked the horse in its fanciest caparison, chose a
magnificent helmet, and rode ofi&quot; to javiac.

On hearing that her beloved had returned, Guillelma rushed to see
him, knelt before him, dropped her veil to kiss him, and begged forgive-
ness for whatever slight had caused his anger. Imagine his confusion and
despairw-his plan had failed abysmally. She was not angry, she had never
been angry, she was only deeper in love, and he would never experience
the joy of reconciliation after a quarrel. Seeing her now, and still desperate

to taste that joy, he decided to try one more time: He drove her away with
harsh words and threatening gestures. She left, this time vowing never to
see him again.

The next morning the troubadour regretted what he had done. He
rode back to javiac, but the lady would not receive him, and ordered her
servants to chase him away, across the drawbridge and over the hill. Guil-
laume fled. Back in his chamber he collapsed and started to cry: He had
made a terrible mistake. Over the next year, unable to see his lady, he ex-
perienced the absence, the terrible absence, that can only inflame love. He
wrote one of his most beautiful poems, “My song ascends for mercy pray-
ing.” And he sent many letters to Guillelma, explaining what he had done,
and begging forgiveness.

After a great deal of this, Lady Guillelma, remembering his beautiful
songs, his handsome figure, and his skills in dancing and falconry, found
herself yearning to have him back. As penance for his cruelty, she ordered
him to remove the nail from the little finger of his right hand, and to send it
to her along with a poem describing his miseries.

He did as she asked. Finally Guillaume de Balaun was able to taste the
ultimate sensation—-a reconciliation even surpassing that of his friend
Pierre.

Interpretation
Trying to discover the joys of reconciliation, Guillaume de Balaun inadver—
tently experienced the truth of the law of absence and presence. At the
start of an affair, you need to heighten your presence in the eyes of the
other. If you absent yourself too early, you may be forgotten. But once
your lover‘s emotions are engaged, and the feeling of love has crystallized,
absence inflames and excites. Giving no reason for your absence excites
even more: The other person assumes he or she is at fault. While you are
away, the lover’s imagination takes flight, and a stimulated imagination
cannot help but make love grow stronger. Conversely, the more Guillelma
pursued Guillaume, the less he loved her—she had become too present,
too accessible, leaving no room for his imagination and fancy, so that his
feelings were suffocating. When she finally stopped sending messengers,
he was able to breathe again, and to return to his plan.

What withdraws, what becomes scarce, suddenly seems to deserve our
respect and honor. What stays too long, inundating us with its presence,
makes us disdain it. In the Middle Ages, ladies were constantly putting
their knights through trials of love, sending them on some long and ardu-
ous quest—-all to create a pattern of absence and presence. Indeed, had
Guillaume not left his lady in the first place, she might have been forced to
send him away, creating an absence of her own.

Absence diminishes minarrpassianr and inflame: great ones,
as the wind clauses a candle andfams aflre.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
For many centuries the Assyrians ruled upper Asia with an iron fist. In the
the people of Medea (now northwestern
eighth century B.C., however,
Iran) revolted against them, and finally broke free. Now the Medes had to
establish a new government. Determined to avoid any form of despotism,
they refused to give ultimate power to any one man, or to establish a
monarchy. Without a leader, however, the country soon fell into chaos,
and fractured into small kingdoms, with village fighting against village.

In one such village lived a man named Deioces, who began to make a

name for himself for fair dealing and the ability to settle disputes.

He did this so successfully, in fact, that soon any legal conflict in the
area was brought to him, and his power increased. Throughout the land,
the law had fallen into disrepute-——the judges were corrupt, and no one en-
trusted their cases to the courts any more, resorting to violence instead.
When news spread of Deioces’ wisdom, incormptibility, and unshakable
impartiality, Medean villages far and wide turned to him to settle all man-
ner of cases. Soon he became the sole arbiter of justice in the land.

At the height of his power, Deioces suddenly decided he had had
enough. He would no longer sit in the chair of judgment, would hear no
more suits, settle no more disputes between brother and brother, village
and village. Complaining that he was spending so much time dealing with
other people’s problems that he had neglected his own affairs, he retired.
The country once again descended into chaos. With the sudden with-
drawal of a powerful arbiter like Deioces, crime increased, and contempt
for the law was never greater. The Medes held a meeting of all the villages
to decide how to get out of their predicament. “We cannot continue to live
in this country under these conditions,” said one tribal leader. “Let us ap-
point one of our number to rule so that we can live under orderly govern-
ment, rather than losing our homes altogether in the present chaos.”

And so, despite all that the Medes had suffered under the Assyrian des-
potism, they decided to set up a monarchy and name a king. And the man
they most wanted to rule, of course, was the fair-minded Deioces. He was
hard to convince, for he wanted nothing more to do with the villages’
in-
fighting and bickering, but the Medes begged and pleaded—without him the
country had descended into a state of lawlessness. Deioces finally agreed.

Yet he also imposed conditions. An enormous palace was to be con-
structed for him, he was to be provided with bodyguards, and a capital city
was to be built from which he could rule. All of this was done, and Deioces
settled into his palace. In the center of the capital,
the palace was sur-
rounded by walls, and completely inaccessible to ordinary people. Deioces
then established the terms of his rule: Admission to his presence was for-
bidden. Communication with the king was only possible through messen-
gers. No one in the royal court could see him more than once a week, and
then only by permission.

Deioces ruled for fifty—three years, extended the Medean empire, and
established the foundation for what would later be the Persian empire,
under his great—great—grandson Cyrus. During Deioces’ reign, the people’s

118

LAW 16

respect for him gradually turned into a form of worship: He was not a mere
mortal, they believed, but the son of a god.

Interpretation
Deioces was a man of great ambition. He determined early on that the
country needed a strong ruler, and that he was the man for the job.

ln a land plagued with anarchy, the most powerful man is the judge
and arbiter. So Deioces began his career by making his reputation as a man
of impeccable fairness.

At the height of his power as a judge, however, Deioces realized the
truth of the law of absence and presence: By serving so many clients, he
had become too noticeable, too available, and had lost the respect he had
earlier enjoyed. People were taking his services for granted. The only way
to regain the veneration and power he wanted was to withdraw com-
pletely, and let the Medes taste what life was like without him. As he ex-
pected, they came begging for him to rule.

Once Deioces had discovered the truth of this law, he carried it to its
ultimate realization. In the palace his people had built for him, none could
see him except a few courtiers, and those only rarely. As Herodotus wrote,
“There was a risk that if they saw him habitually, it might lead to jealousy
and resentment, and plots would follow; but if nobody saw him, the legend
would grow that he was a being of a different order from more men.”

A man said to a Dervish.‘ “Why do I not see you mm ofim?&quot; The Dervish
replied, “Because the words ‘Why have you not been to see me?’ are
sweeter to my ear than the words ‘Why have you come again .9’ ”
Mnlllofami. quoted in [dries S./uzh &#x27;5 (Jaravan of I)remns_. 1.968

KEYS TO POWER
Everything in the world depends on absence and presence. A strong pres-
ence will draw power and attention to you—you shine more brightly than
those around you. But a point is inevitably reached where too much pres-
ence creates the opposite effect: The more you are seen and heard from,
the more your value degrades. You become a habit. No matter how hard
you try to be different, subtly, without your knowing why. people respect
you less and less. At the right moment you must leam to withdraw yourself
before they unconsciously push you away. It is a game of hide—and~seek.

The truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love
and seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the 1over‘s absence stim-
ulates your imagination, forming a sort of aura around him or her. But this
aura fades when you know too much--~when your imagination no longer
has room to roam. The loved one becomes a person like anyone else, a
person whose presence is taken for granted. This is why the seventeenth-
century French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos advised constant feints at with
drawal from one’s lover. “Love never dies of starvation,” she wrote, “but
often of indigestion.”

LAW 16

.

119

The moment you allow yourself to be treated like anyone else, it is too
late--you are swallowed and digested To prevent this you need to starve
the other poison of your presence. Force their respect by threatening them
with the possibility that they will lose you for good; create a pattern of pres-
ence and absence.

Once you die, everything about you will seem different. You will be
surrounded by an instant aura of respect. People will remember their criti~
cisms of you, their arguments with you, and will be filled with regret and
guilt. They are missing a presence that will never return. But you do not
have to wait until you die: By completely withdrawing for a while, you cre-
ate a kind of death before death. And when you come back, it will be as if
you had come back from the dead--an air of resuirection will cling to you,
and people will be relieved at your return. This is how Deioces made him~
self king.

Napoleon was recognizing the law of absence and presence when he
said, “If I am often seen at the theater, people will cease to notice me.”
Today, in a world inundated with presence through the flood of images, the
is all the more powerful. We rarely know when to
game of withdrawal
withdraw anymore, and nothing seems private, so we are awed by anyone
who is able to disappear by choice. Novelists J. D. Salinger and Thomas
Pynchon have created cultlike followings by knowing when to disappear.

Another, more everyday side of this law, but one that demonstrates
its truth even further, is the law of scarcity in the science of economics.
By withdrawing something from the market, you create instant value. In
seventeenth-century Holland, the upper classes wanted to make the tulip
more than just a beautiful flower——they wanted it to be a kind of status sym~
bol. Making the flower scarce, indeed almost impossible to obtain, they
sparked what was later called tulipomania. A single flower was now worth
more than its weight in gold. In our own century, similarly, the art dealer
Joseph Duveen insisted on making the paintings he sold as scarce and rare
as possible. To keep their prices elevated and their status high, he bought up
whole collections and stored them in his basement. The paintings that he
sold became more than just paintings-—t.hey were fetish objects, their value
increased by their rarity. “You can get all the pictures you want at fifty thou-
sand dollars apiece~—-that’s easy,” he once said. “But to get pictures at a
quarter of a million apiece—that wants doing!”

LAW 16

Extend the law of scarcity to your own skills. Make what you are offer-

ing the world rare and hard to find, and you instantly increase its value.

There always comes a moment when those in power overstay their
welcome. We have grown tired of them, lost respect for them; we see them
as no different from the rest of mankind, which is to say that we see them as
rather worse, since we inevitably compare their current status in our eyes
to their former one. There is an art to knowing when to retire. If it is done
right, you regain the respect you had lost, and retain a part of your power.
The greatest ruler of the sixteenth century was Charles V. King of
Spain, Hapsburg emperor, he governed an empire that at one point in-
clucled much of Europe and the New World. Yet at the height of his power,
in 1557, he retired to the monastery of Yuste. All of Europe was captivated
by his sudden withdrawal; people who had hated anti feared him suddenly
called him great, and he came to be seen as a saint. In more recent times,
the film actress Greta Garbo was never more admired than when she re
tired, in 1941, For some her absence came too soon—sl1e was in her mid-
thirties—but she wisely preferred to leave on her own terms, rather than
waiting for her audience to grow tired of her.

Make yourself too available and the aura of power you have created
around yourself will wear away. Turn the game around: Make yourself less
accessible and you increase the value of your presence.

Authority:
Use absence to create
respect and esteem. If presence
diminishes fame, absence augments it.
A man who when absent is regarded as a
lion becomes when present something com-
mon and ridiculous. Talents lose their luster

if we become too familiar with them,
for the
outer shell of the mind is more readily seen
than its rich inner kernel. Even the outstand«
ing genius makes use of retirement so that

men may honor him and so that

the

yearning aroused by his absence
may cause him to be esteemed.
(Baltasar Grecian,
l60lvl658)

LAW 16

I21

REVERSAL
This law only applies once a certain level of power has been attained. The
need to withdraw only comes after you have established your presence;
leave too early and you do not increase your respect, you are simply for-
gotten. When you are first entering onto the world’: stage, create an image
that is recognizable, reproducible, and is seen everywhere. Until that status
is attained, absence is dangerous—instead of farming the flames, it will ex-
tinguish them.

In love and seduction, similarly, absence is only effective once you
have surrounded the other with your image, been seen by him or her
everywhere. Everything must remind your lover of your presence, so that
when you do choose to be away, the lover will always be thinking of you,
will always be seeing you in his or her mind’s eye.

Remember:

In the beginning, make yourself not scarce but om-
nipresent. Only what is seen, appreciated, and loved will be missed in its
absence.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In May of 1972, chess champion Boris Spassky anxiously awaited his rival
Bobby Fischer in Reylqavik, Iceland. The two men had been scheduled to
meet for the World Championship of Chess, but Fischer had not arrived on
time and the match was on hold. Fischer had problems with the size of the
prize money, problems with the way the money was to be distributed,
problems with the logistics of holding the match in Iceland. He might back
out at any moment.

Spassky tried to be patient. His Russian bosses felt that Fischer was hu—
miliating him and told him to walk away, but Spassky wanted this match.
He knew he could destroy Fischer, and nothing was going to spoil the
greatest victory of his career. “So it seems that all our work may come to
nothing,” Spassky told a comrade. “But what can we do? It is Bobby’s
move. If he comes, we play. If he does not come; we do not play. A man
who is willing to commit suicide has the initiative.”

Fischer finally arrived in Reykjavik, but the problems, and the threat
of cancellation, continued. He disliked the hall where the match was to be
fought, he criticized the lighting, he complained about the noise of the
cameras, he even hated the chairs in which he and Spassky were to sit
Now the Soviet Union took the initiative and threatened to withdraw their

man.

The bluff apparently worked: After all the weeks of waiting, the end-
less and infuriating negotiations, Fischer agreed to play. Everyone was re-
the ofiicial
lieved, no one more than Spassky. But on the day of
introductions, Fischer arrived very late, and on the day when the “Match
of the Century” was to begin, he was late again. This fime, however, the
consequences would be dire: If he showed up too late he would forfeit the
first game. What was going on? Was he playing some sort of mind game?
Or was Bobby Fischer perhaps afraid of Boris Spassky? It seemed to the as-
sembled grand masters, and to Spassky, that this young kid from Brooklyn
had a terrible case of the jitters. At 5:09 Fischer showed up, exactly one
minute before the match was to be canceled.

The first game of a chess tournament is critical, since it sets the tone for
the months to come. It is often a slow and quiet struggle, with the two play-
ers preparing themselves for the war and trying to read each other’s strate-
gies. This game was different. Fischer made a terrible move early on,
perhaps the worst of his career, and when Spassky had him on the ropes,
he seemed to give up. Yet Spassky knew that Fischer never gave up. Even
when facing checkmate, he fought to the bitter end, wearing the opponent
down. This time, though, he seemed resigned. Then suddenly he broke out
a bold move that put the room in a buzz. The move shocked Spassky, but
he recovered and managed to win the game. But no one could figure out
what Fischer was up to. Had he lost deliberately? Or was he rattled? Unset-
tled? Even, as some thought, insane?

After his defeat in the first game, Fischer complained all the more
loudly about the room, the cameras, and everything else. He also failed to

show up on time for the second game. This time the organizers had had
enough: He was given a forfeit. Now he was down two games to none, at
position from which no one had ever come back to win a chess champi-
onship. Fischer was clearly unhinged. Yet in the third game, as all those
who witnessed it remember, he had a ferocious look in his eye, a look that
clearly bothered Spassky. And despite the hole he had dug for himself, he
seemed supremely confident. He did make what appeared to be another
blunder, as he had in the first game—but his cocky air made Spassky smell
a trap. Yet despite the Russian’s suspicions, he could not figure out the trap,
and before he knew it Fischer had checkmated him. In fact Fischer’s un—
orthodox tactics had completely unnerved his opponent. At the end of the
game, Fischer leaped up and rushed out, yelling to his confederates as he
smashed a list into his palm, “I’m crushing him with brute force!”

In the next games Fischer pulled moves that no one had seen from
him before, moves that were not his style. Now Spassky started to make
blunders. After losing the sixth game, he started to cry. One grand master
said, “After this, Spassky’s got to ask himself if it’s safe to go back to Rus-
sia.&quot; After the eighth game Spassky decided he knew what was happening:
Bobby Fischer was hypnotizing him. He decided not to look Fischer in the
eye; he lost anyway.

After the fourteenth game he called a staff conference and announced,
“An attempt is being made to control my mind.” He wondered whether the
orange juice they drank at
the chess table could have been drugged.
Maybe chemicals were being blown into the air. Finally Spassky went pub—
lic, accusing the Fischer team of putting something in the chairs that was a1»
tering Spassky’s mind. The KGB went on alert: Boris Spassky was
embarrassing the Soviet Union!

The chairs were taken apart and X—rayed. A chemist found nothing
unusual in them. The only things anyone found anywhere, in fact, were
two dead flies in a lighting fixture. Spassky began to complain of hallucina-
tions. He tried to keep playdng, but his mind was unraveling. He could not
go on. On September 2, he resigned. Although still relatively young, he
never recovered from this defeat.

Interpretation

In previous games between Fischer and Spassky, Fischer had not fared
well. Spassky had an uncanny ability to read his opponent’s strategy and
use it against him. Adaptable and patient, he would build attacks that would
defeat not in seven moves but in seventy. He defeated Fischer every time
they played because he saw much further ahead, and because he was a bril-
liant psychologist who never lost control. One master said, “He doesn’t just
look for the best move. He looks for the move that will disturb the man he
is playing.”

Fischer, however, finally understood that this was one of the keys to
Spassky’s success: He played on your predictability, defeated you at your
own game. Everything Fischer did for the championship match was an at-

LAW 17

125

tempt to put the initiative on his side and to keep Spassl-Ly offibalance.
Clearly the endless waiting had an effect on Spassky’s psyche. Most power-
ful of all, though, were Fischer’s deliberate blunders and his appearance of
having no clear strategy. In fact, he was doing everything he could to
scramble his old patterns, even if it meant losing the first match and forfeit-
ing the second.

Spassky was known for his sangfroid and levelheadedness, but for the
first time in his life he could not figure out his opponent. He slowly melted
down, until at the end he was the one who seemed insane.

Chess contains the concentrated essence of life: First, because to win
you have to be supremely patient and farseeing; and second, because the
game is built on patterns, whole sequences of moves that have been played
before and will be played again, with slight alterations, in any one match
Your opponent analyzes the patterns you are playing and uses them to try
to foresee your moves. Allowing him nothing predictable to base his strat-
egy on gives you a big advantage. In chess as in life, when people cannot
figure out what you are doing, they are kept in a state of terror—waiting,
uncertain, confused,

Life at court is a serious, melancholy game of chess, which requires us to draw
up our pieces and batteries, form a plan, pursue it, parry that of our
adversary. Sometimes, however, it is better to take risks
and play the most capricious, unpredictable mave.

lean (1rI.a Bruyéw,

KEYS TO POWER
Nothing is more terrifying than the sudden and unpredictable. That is why
we are so frightened by earthquakes and tornadoes: We do not know when
they will strike. Alter one has occurred, we wait in terror for the next one.
To a lesser degree, this is the effect that unpredictable human behavior has

on us.

Animals behave in set patterns, which is why we are able to hunt and
kill them. Only man has the capacity to consciously alter his behavior, to
improvise and overcome the weight of routine and habit. Yet most men do
not realize this power. They prefer the comforts of routine, of giving in to
the animal nature that has them repeating the same compulsive actions
time and time again. They do this because it requires no effort, and be-
cause they mistakenly believe that if they do not unsettle others, they will
be left alone. Understand: A person of power instills a kind of fear by delib-
erately unsettling those around him to keep the initiative on his side. You
sometimes need to strike without waming, to make others tremble when
they least expect it. It is a device that the powerful have used for centuries.
Filippo Maria, the last of the Visconti dukes of Milan in fifteenth»
century Italy, consciously did the opposite of what everyone expected of
him. For instance, he might suddenly shower a courtier with attention, and
then, once the man had come to expect a promotion to higher office,

I26

LAW 17

would suddenly start treating him with the utmost disdain. Confused, the
man might leave the court, when the duke would suddenly recall him and
start treating him well again. Doubly confused, the courtier would wonder
whether his assumption that he would be promoted had become obvious,
and offensive, to the duke, and would start to behave as if he no longer ex-
pected such honor. The duke would rebuke him for his lack of ambition
and would send him away.

The secret of dealing with Filippo was simple: Do not presume to
know what he wants. Do not try to guess what will please him. Never inject
your will; just surrender to his will. Then wait to see what happens. Amidst
the confusion and uncertainty he created, the duke ruled supreme, unchal-
lenged and at peace.

Unpredictability is most often the tactic of the master, but the under-
dog too can use it to great effect. If you find yourself outnumbered or cor-
nered, throw in a series of unpredictable moves. Your enemies will be so
confused that they will pull back or make a tactical blunder.

In the spring of 1862, during the American Civil War, General
Stonewall Jackson and a force of 4,600 Confederate soldiers were torment»
ing the larger Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley. Meanwhile, not far
away, General George Brinton McClellan, heading a force of 90,000
Union soldiers, was marching south from Washington, D.C., to lay siege to
Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, As the weeks of the cam-
paign went by, Jackson repeatedly led his soldiers out of the Shenandoah
Valley, then back to it.

His movements made no sense. Was he preparing to help defend
Richmond? Was he marching on Washington, now that McClellan’s ab-
sence had left it unprotected? Was be heading north to wreak havoc up
there? Why was his small force moving in circles?

Jacksorfs inexplicable moves made the Union generals delay the
march on Richmond as they waited to figure out what he was up to. Mean-
while, the South was able to pour reinforcements into the town. A battle
that could have crushed the Confederacy turned into a stalemate. Jackson
used this tactic time and again when facing numerically superior forces.
“Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible,” he said,
“. .
. such tactics will win every time and a small army may thus destroy a
large ones”

This law applies not only to war but to everyday situations. People are
always trying to read the motives behind your actions and to use your pre«
dictability against you. Throw in at completely inexplicable move and you
put them on the defensive. Because they do not understand you, they are
unnerved, and in such a state you can easily intimidate them.

Pablo Picasso once remarked, “The best calculation is the absence of
calculation. Once you have attained a certain level of recognition, others
generally figure that when you do something, it’ s for an intelligent reason.
So it’s really foolish to plot out your movements too carefully in advance.
You’re better off acting capriciously.”

For a while, Picasso worked with the ait dealer Paul Rosenberg. At first

LAW 17

127

he allowed him a fair amount of latitude in handling his paintings, then one
day, for no apparent reason, he told the man he would no longer give him
any work to sell. As Picasso explained, “Rosenberg would spend the next
forty-eight hours trying to figure out why. Was I reserving things for some
other dealer? I’d go on working and sleeping and Rosenberg would spend
his time figuring. In two days he’d come back, nerves jangled, anxious, say»
ing, ‘After all, dear friend, you wouldn’t turn me down if I offered you this
much [naming a substantially higher figure] for those paintings rather than
the price Pve been accustomed to paying you, would you?’ ”

Unpredictability is not only a weapon of terror: Scrambling your pat-
terns on a day-to-day basis will cause a stir around you and stimulate intet—
est. People will talk about you, ascribe motives and explanations that have
nothing to do with the truth, but that keep you constantly in their minds. In
the end, the more capricious you appear, the more respect you will garner.
Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner.

REVERSAL
Sometimes predictability can work in your favor: By creating a pattern for
people to be familiar and comfortable with, you can lull them to sleep.
They have prepared everything according to their preconceived notions
about you. You can use this in several ways: First, it sets up a smoke screen,
a comfortable front behind which you can carry on deceptive actions. Sec
ond, it allows you on rare occasions to do something completely against
the pattern, unsettling your opponent so deeply he will fall to the ground
without being pushed.

In 1974 Muhammad Ali and George Foreman were scheduled to fight
for the world heavyweight boxing championship. Everyone knew what
would happen: Big George Foreman would try to land a knockout punch
while Ali would dance around him, wearing him out. That was Ali’s way of
fighting, his pattern, and he had not changed it in more than ten years. But
in this case it seemed to give Foreman the advantage: He had a devastating
punch, and if he waited, sooner or later Ali would have to come to him.
Ali, the master strategist, had other plans: In press conferences before the
big fight, he said he was going to change his style and punch it out with
Foreman. No one, least of all Foreman, believed this for a second. That
plan would be suicide on Ali’s part; he was playing the comedian, as usual.
Then, before the fight, Ali’s trainer loosened the ropes around the ring,
something a trainer would do if his boxer were intending to slug it out. But
no one believed this play; it had to be a setup.

To everyone’s amazement, Ali did exactly what he had said he would
do. As Foreman waited for him to dance around, Ali went right up to him
and slugged it out. He completely upset his opponent’s strategy. At a loss,
Foreman ended up wearing himself out, not by chasing Ali but by throw-
ing punches wildly, and taking more and more counterpunches. Finally,
Ali landed a dramatic right cross that knocked out Foreman. The habit of
assuming that a person’s behavior will fit its previous patterns is so strong
that not even Ali’s announcement of a strategy change was enough to upset
it. Foreman walked into a trap-«the trap he had been told to expect.

A warning: Unpredictability can work against you sometimes, es
pecially if you are in a subordinate position. There are times when it is bet
ter to let people feel comfortable and settled around you than to disturb
thern. Too much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiveness, or
even of some more serious psychic problem. Rattems are powerful, and
you can terrify people by disrupting them. Such power should only be
used judiciously.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAVV
Ch’in Shih Huang Ti, the first emperor of China (221-210 B.C.), was the
mightiest man of his day. His empire was vaster and more powerful than
that of Alexander the Great. He had conquered all of the kingdoms sur-
rounding his own kingdom of Chin and unified them into one massive
realm called China. But in the last years of his life, few, if anyone, saw him.
The emperor lived in the most magnificent palace built to that date, in
the capital of Hsien-yang. The palace had 270 pavilions; all of these were
connected by secret underground passageways, allowing the emperor to
move through the palace without anyone seeing him. He slept in a differ-—
ent room every night, and anyone who inadvertently laid eyes on him was
instantly beheaded. Only a handful of men knew his whereabouts, and if
they revealed it to anyone, they, too, were put to death.

The first emperor had grown so terrified of human Contact that when
he had to leave the palace he traveled incognito, disguising himself care
fully. On one such trip through the provinces, he suddenly died. His body
was borne back to the capital in the emperor’s carriage, with a cart packed
with salted fish trailing behind it to cover up the smell of the rotting
corpse-—~no one was to know of his death. He died alone, far from his
wives, his family, his friends, and his courfiers, accompanied only by a
minister and a handful of eunuchs.

Interpretation
Shih Huang Ti started off as the king of Ch’in, a fearless warrior of unbri-
dled ambition. Writers of the time described him as a man with “a waspish
nose, eyes like slits, the voice of a jackal, and the heart of a tiger or wolf.”
He could be merciful sometimes, but more often he “swallowed men up
without a scruple.” It was through trickery and violence that he conquered
the provinces surrounding his own and created China, forging a single na-
tion and culture out of many. He broke up the feudal system, and to keep
an eye on the many members of the royal families that were scattered
across the realm’s various kingdoms, he moved 120,000 of them to the cap-
ital, where he housed the most important couxtiers in the vast palace of
Hsienyang. He consolidated the many walls on the borders and built them
into the Great Wall of China. He standardized the country’s laws, its writ-
ten language, even the size of its cartwheels.

As part of this process of unification, however, the first emperor out-
lawed the writings and teachings of Confucius,
the philosopher whose
ideas on the moral life had already become virtually a religion in Chinese
culture. On Shih Huang Ti’s order, thousands of books relating to Confu-
cius were burned, and anyone who quoted Confucius was to be beheaded.
This made many enemies for the emperor, and he grew constantly afraid,
even paranoid. The executions mounted. A contemporary, the writer Han-
fei-tzu, noted that “Ch’in has been victorious for four generations, yet has
lived in constant terror and apprehension of destruction.”

himself, he slowly lost control of the realm. Eunuchs and ministers enacted
political policies without his approval or even his knowledge; they also
plotted against him. By the end, he was emperor in name only, and was so
isolated that barely anyone knew he had died. He had probably been poi-
soned by the same scheming ministers who encouraged his isolation.

That is what isolation brings: Retreat into a. fortress and you lose con-
tact with the sources of your power. You lose your ear for what is happen-
ing around you, as well as a sense of proportion. Instead of being safer, you
cut yourself off from the kind of knowledge on which your life depends.
Never enclose yourself so far from the streets that you cannot hear what is
happening around you, including the plots against you.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Louis XIV had the palace of Versailles built for him and his court in the
16605, and it was like no other royal palace in the world. As in El, beehive,
everything revolved around the royal person. He lived surrounded by the
nobility, who were allotted apartments nestled around his, their closeness
to him dependent on their rank. The kings bedroom occupied the literal
center of the palace and was the focus of everyone’s attention. Every mom~
ing the king was greeted in this room by a ritual known as the lever.

At eight A.M., the king&#x27;s first valet, who slept at the foot of the royal
bed, would awaken His Majesty. Then pages would open the door and
admit those who had a. function in the lever. The order of their entry was
precise: First came the king’s illegitimate sons and his grandchildren, then
the princes and princesses of the blood, and then his physician and sur-
geon. There followed the grand ollicers of the wardrobe, the king’s oflicial
reader, and those in charge of entertaining the king‘ Next would arrive var-
ious government officials. in ascending order of rank. Last but not least
came those attending the [ever by special invitation. By the end of the cere»
many, the room would be packed with well over a hundred royal atten»
dams and visitors.

The day was organized so that all the palace’s energy was directed at
and passed through the king. Louis was constantly attended by courtiers
and officials, all asking for his advice and judgment. To all their questions
he usually replied, “I shall see.”

As Saint-Simon noted, “If he turned to someone, asked him a ques-
tion, made an insignificant remark, the eyes of all present were turned on
this person. It was a distinction that was talked of and increased prestige.”
There was no possibility of privacy in the palace, not even for the king-
every room communicated with another, and every hallway led to larger
rooms where groups of nobles gathered constantly. Everyone’s actions
were interdependent, and nothing and no one passed unnoticed: “The
king not only saw to it that all the high nobility was present at his court,”
wrote Saint—Simon, “he demanded the same of the minor nobility. At his
lever and voucher, at his meals, in his gardens of Versailles, he always looked

about him, noticing everything. He was offended if the most distinguished
nobles did not live permanently at court, and those who showed them-
selves never or hardly ever, incurred his full displeasure. If one of these de
sired something, the king would say proudly: ‘I do not know him,’ and the
judgment was irrevocable.”

Interpretation
Louis XIV came to power at the end of a terrible civil war, the Fronde. A
principal instigator of the war had been the nobility, which deeply resented
the growing power of the throne and yearned for the days of feudalism,
when the lords ruled their own fiefdoms and the king had little authority
over them. The nobles had lost the civil war, but they remained a fractious,
resentful lot.

The construction of Versailles, then, was far more than the decadent
whim of a luxury—1oving king. It served a crucial function: The king could
keep an eye and an ear on everyone and everything around him. The
once proud nobility was reduced to squabbling over the right to help the
king put on his robes in the morning. There was no possibility here of pm?
vacy--no possibility of isolation. Louis XIV very early grasped the truth
that for a king to isolate himself is gravely dangerous. In his absence, con-
spiracies will spring up like mushrooms after rain, animosities will crystal-
lize into factions, and rebellion will break out before he has the time to
react. To combat this, sociability and openness must not only be encour-
aged, they must be formally organized and channeled.

These conditions at Versailles lasted for Louis’s entire reign, some fifty
years of relative peace and tranquillity. Through it all, not a pin dropped
without Louis hearing it.

Solitude is dangerous to reason, without beingfavorable to virtue. .

KEYS TO POWER
Machiavelli makes the argument that in a strictly military sense a fortress is
invariably a mistake. It becomes a symbol of power&#x27;s isolation, and is an
easy target for its builders’ enemies. Designed to defend you, fortresses ac—
tually cut you off from help and cut into your flexibility. They may appear
impregnable, but once you retire to one, everyone knows where you are;
and a siege does not have to succeed to turn your fortress into a prison.
With their small and confined spaces, fortresses are also extremely vulnerv
able to the plague and contagious diseases, In a strategic sense, the iso-
lation of a fortress provides no protection, and actually creates more
problems than it solves.

Because humans are social creatures by nature, power depends on so-
cial interaction and circulation. To make yourself powerful you must place
yourself at the center of things, as Louis XIV did at Versailles. All activity
should revolve around you, and you should be aware of everything hap-
pening on the street, and of anyone who might be hatching plots against
you. The danger for most people comes when they feel threatened. In such
times they tend to retreat and close ranks, to find security in a kind of
fortress. In doing so, however, they come to rely for information on a
smaller and smaller circle, and lose perspective on events around them.
They lose maneuverability and become easy targets, and their isolation
makes them paranoid. As in warfare and most games of strategy, isolation
often precedes defeat and death.

In moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this desire to
turn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out old allies and
make new ones, force yourself into more and more different circles. This
has been the trick of powerful people for centuries.

The Roman statesman Cicero was born into the lower nobility, and
had little chance of power unless he managed to make a place for himself
among the aristocrats who controlled the city. He succeeded brilliantly,
identifying everyone with influence and figuring out how they were con-
nected to one another. He mingled everywhere, knew everyone, and had
such a vast network of connections that an enemy here could easily be
counterbalanced by an ally there,

The French statesman Talleyrand played the game the same way. Al-
though he came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in France, he
made a point of always staying in touch with what was happening in the
streets of Paris, allowing him to foresee trends and troubles. He even got a
certain pleasure out of mingling with shady criminal types, who supplied
him with valuable information. Every time there was a crisis, a transition of
power--the end of the Directory, the fall of Napoleon, the abdication of
Louis XVIII-~he was able to survive and even thrive, because he never
closed himself up in a small circle but always forged connections with the
new order.

This law pertains to kings and queens, and to those of the highest
power: The moment you lose contact with your people, seeking security in
isolation, rebellion is brewing. Never imagine yourself so elevated that you
can afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest echelons. By retreating
to a fortress, you make yourself an easy target for your plotting subjects,
who view your isolation as an insult and a reason for rebellion.

Since humans are such social creatures, it follows that the social arts
that make us pleasant to be around can be practiced only by constant ex-
posure and circulation. The more you are in contact with others, the more
graceful and at ease you become. Isolation, on the other hand, engenders
an awkwardness in your gestures, and leads to further isolation, as people
start avoidmg you.

In 1545 Duke Cosimo I de’ Medici decided that to ensure the immor-

l 34

LAW 18

tality of his name he would commission frescoes for the main chapel of the
church of San Lorenzo in Florence. He had many great painters to choose
from, and in the end he picked jacopo da Pontonno. Getting on in years,
Pontormo wanted to make these frescoes his chef d’oeuvre and legacy. His
first decision was to close the chapel off with walls, partitions, and blinds.
He wanted no one to witness the creation of his masterpiece, or to steal his
ideas. He would outdo Michelangelo himself. When some young men
broke into the chapel out of curiosity, jacopo sealed it off even further.

Pontormo filled the chape1’s ceiling with biblical scenes—the Creation,
Adam and Eve, Noah&#x27;s ark, on and on. At the top of the middle will he
painted Christ in his majesty, raising the dead onjudgment Day. The artist
worked on the chapel for eleven years, rarely leaving it, since he had de—
veloped a phobia for human contact and was afraid his ideas would be
stolen.

Ponrormo died before completing the frescoes, and none of them has
survived. But the great Renaissance writer Vasari, a friend of Pontormds
who saw the frescoes shortly after the artist’s death, left a description of
what they looked like. There was a total
lack of proportion. Scenes
bumped against scenes, figures in one story being juxtaposed with those in
another, in maddening numbers. Pontormo had become obsessed with de»
tall but had lost any sense of the overall composition. Vasari left off his de~
scription of the frescoes by writing that if he continued, “I think I would go
mad and become entangled in this painting, just as I believe that in the
eleven years of time jacopo spent on it, he entangled himself and anyone
else who saw it.” Instead of crowning Pontormo’s career, the work became
his undoing.

These frescoes were visual equivalents of the effects of isolation on the
human mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail combined with
an inability to see the larger picture, a kind of extravagant ugliness that no
longer communicates. Clearly, isolation is as deadly for the creative arts as
for the social arts. Shakespeare is the most famous writer in history be-
cause, as a dramatist for the popular stage, he opened himself up to the
masses, making his work accessible to people no matter what their educa-
tion and taste. Artists who hole themselves up in their fortress lose a sense
of proportion, their work communicating only to their small circle. Such
art remains cornered and powerless.

Finally, since power is a human creation, it is inevitably increased by
Contact with other people.
Instead of falling into the fortress mentality,
view the world in the following manner: It is like a vast Versailles, with
every room communicating with another. You need to be permeable, able
to float in and out of different circles and mix with different types. That
kind of mobility and social contact will protect you from plotters, who will
be unable to keep secrets from you, and from your enemies, who will be
unable to isolate you from your allies. Always on the move, you mix and
mingle in the rooms of the palace, never sitting or settling in one place. No
hunter can fix his aim on such a svvifbmoving creature.

REVE RSAL
It is hardly ever right and propitious to choose isolation. Without keeping
an ear on what is happening in the streets, you will be unable to protect
yourself. About the only thing that constant human contact cannot facili~
tate is thought. The weight of society&#x27;s pressure to conform, and the lack of
distance from other people, can make it impossible to think clearly about
what is going on around you. As a temporary recourse, then, isolation can
help you to gain perspective. Many a serious thinker has been produced in
prisons, where we have nothing to do but think. Machiavelli could write
The Prince only once he found himself in exile and isolated on a farm far
from the political intrigues of Florence.

The danger is, however, that this kind of isolation will sire all kinds of
strange and perverted ideas. You may gain perspective on the larger pic-
ture, but you lose a sense of your own smallness and limitations. Also, the
more isolated you are, the harder it is to break out of your isolation when
you choose to——it sinks you deep into its quicksand without your noticing.
If you need time to think, then, choose isolation only as a last resort, and
only in small doses. Be careful to keep your way back into society open.

13?’

OPPON ENTS, SUCKERS, AND VICTIMS: Preliminary Typology
In your rise to power you will come across many breeds of opponent,
sucker, and victim. The highest form of the art of power is the ability to dis-
tinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from the hares, the hawks
from the vultures. If you make this distinction well, you will succeed with»
out needing to coerce anyone too much. But if you deal blindly with
whomever crosses your path, you will have a life of constant sorrow, if you
even live that long. Being able to recognize types of people, and to act ac-
cordingly, is critical. The following are the five most dangerous and diffi-
cult
types of mark in the jungle, as identified by artists—con and
othetwise——of the past

The Arrogant and Proud Man. Although he may initially disguise
this man’s touchy pride makes him very dangerous. Any perceived
it,
slight will lead to a vengeance of overwhelming violence. You may say to
yourself, “But I only said such-and-such at a party, where everyone was
drunk. .
. .” It does not matter. There is no sanity behind his over-reaction,
so do not waste time trying to figure him out. If at any point in your deal
ings with a person you sense an oversensitive and overactive pride, flee.
Whatever you are hoping for from him isn&#x27;t worth it.

The Hopelessly Insecure Man. This man is related to the proud and ar-
rogant type, but is less violent and harder to spot. His ego is fragile, his
sense of self insecure, and if he feels himself deceived or attacked, the hurt
will simmer. He will attack you in bites that will take forever to get big
enough for you to notice. If you find you have deceived or harmed such a
man, disappear for a long time. Do not stay around him or he will nibble
you to death.

Mr. Suspicion. Another variant on the breeds above, this is a future _]oe
Stalin. He sees what he wants to see—usually the worst—in other people,
and imagines that everyone is after him. Mr. Suspicion is in fact the least
dangerous of the three: Genuinely unbalanced, he is easy to deceive, just as
Stalin himself was constantly deceived. Play on his suspicious nature to get
him to turn against other people. But if you do become the target of his sus-
picions, watch out.

The Serpent with a Long Memory. If hurt or deceived, this man will
show no anger on the surface; he will calculate and wait. Then, when he is
in a position to turn the tables, he will exact a revenge marked by a cold-
blooded shrewdness. Recognize this man by his calculation and cunning in
the different areas of his life. He is usually cold and unaffectionate. Be dou-
bly careful of this snake, and if you have somehow injured him, either
crush him completely or get him out of your sight.

The Plain, Unassuming, and Often Unintelligent Man. Ah, your ears
prick up when you find such a tempting victim. But this man is a lot harder

merely that he will waste your time, energy, resources, and even your san~

his reaction is utterly literal, this is the type you are dealing with. Continue

TRANSGRESSIONS OF THE LAW

Transgression I
In the early part of the thirteenth century, Muhammad,
the shah of
Khwarezm, managed after many wars to forge a huge empire, extending
west to present-day Turkey and south to Afghanistan. The empire’s center
was the great Asian capital of Samarkand. The shah had a powerful, well-
trained army, and could mobilize 200,000 waniors within days.

In 1219 Muhammad received an embassy from a new tribal leader to
the east, Genghis Khan. The embassy included all sorts of gifts to the great
Muhammad, representing the finest goods from Khan’s small but growing
Mongol empire. Genghis Khan wanted to reopen the Silk Route to Europe,
and offered to share it with Muhammad, while promising peace between
the two empires.

Muhammad did not know this upstart from the east, who, it seemed to
him, was extremely arrogant to try to talk as an equal to one so clearly his
superior. He ignored Khan’s offer. Khan tried again: This time he sent a
caravan of a hundred camels filled with the rarest articles he had plun-
dered from China. Before the caravan reached Muhammad, however,
the governor of a region bordering on Samarkand, seized it
Inalchik,
for himself, and executed its leaders.

&#x27;

Genghis Khan was sure that this was a mistake—that Inalchik had
acted without Muhammad’s approval. He sent yet another mission to
Muhammad, reiterating his offer and asking that the governor be punished.
This time Muhammad himself had one of the ambassadors beheaded, and
sent the other two back with shaved heads-a horrifying insult in the Mon-
gol code of honor. Khan sent a message to the shah: “You have chosen war.
What will happen will happen, and what it is to be we know not; only God
knows.” Mobilizing his forces, in 1220 he attacked Inalchik’s province,
where he seized the capital, captured the governor, and ordered him exe-
cuted by having molten silver poured into his eyes and ears.

Over the next year, Khan led a series of guern‘lla~1ike campaigns
against the sha.h’s much larger army, His method was totally novel for the
time—his soldiers could move very fast on horseback, and had mastered
the art of firing with bow and arrow while mounted. The speed and flexi-
bility of his forces allowed him to deceive Muhammad as to his intentions
and the directions of his movements. Eventually he managed first to sur-

prison, and put Aguirre

round Samarkand, then to seize it. Muhammad fled, and a year later died,
his vast empire broken and destroyed. Genghis Khan was sole master of
Samarkand, the Silk Route, and most of northern Asia.
Interpretation
Never assume that the person you are dealing with is weaker or less impor-
tant than you are. Some men are slow to take offense, which may make
you misjudge the thickness of their skin, and fail to wony about insulting
them. But should you offend their honor and their pride, they will over-
whelm you with a violence that seems sudden and extreme given their
slowness to anger. If you want to turn people down, it is best to do so po~
litely and respectfully, even if you feel their request is impudent or their
offer ridiculous. Never reject them with an insult until you know them bet-
ter; you may be dealing with a Genghis Khan.

Transgression II
In the late 1910s some of the best swindlers in America formed a con-artist
ring based in Denver, Colorado. In the winter months they would spread
across the southern states, plying their trade. In 1920 Joe Furey, a leader of
the ring, was working his way through Texas, making hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars with classic con games. In Fort Worth, he met a sucker
named j. Frank Norileet, a cattleman who owned a large ranch. Nortleet
fell for the con. Convinced of the riches to come, he emptied his bank ac»
count of $45,000 and handed it over to Furey and his Confederates. A few
days later they gave him his “millions,” which turned out to be a few good
dollars wrapped around a packet of newspaper clippings.

Furey and his men had worked such cons a hundred times before, and
the sucker was usually so embarrassed by his gullibility that he quietly
learned his lesson and accepted the loss. But Norfleet was not like other
suckers. He went to the police, who told him there was little they could do.
“Then I’ll go after those people myselfl” Norfleet told the detectives. “I’ll
get them, too, if it takes the rest of my life.” His wife took over the ranch as
Norileet scoured the country, looking for others who had been fleeced in
the same game. One such sucker came forward, and the two men identified
one of the con artists in San Francisco, and managed to get him locked up,
The man committed suicide rather than face a long term in prison.

Norfleet kept going. He tracked down another of the con artists in
Montana, roped him like a calf, and dragged him through the muddy streets
to the town jail. He traveled not only across the country but to England,
Canada, and Mexico in Search ofjoe Furey, and also of Furey’s right-hand
man, W B. Spencer. Finding Spencer in Montreal, Norfleet chased him
through the streets. Spencer escaped but the rancher stayed on his trail and
caught up with him in Salt Lake City. Preferring the mercy of the law to
Nortleet’s wrath, Spencer turned himself in.

=

Norfleet found Furey in Jacksonville, Florida, and personally hauled
him off to face justice in Texas. But he wouldn’t stop there: He continued
on to Denver, determined to break up the entire ring. Spending not only

large sums of money but another year of his life in the pursuit, he managed
to put all of the con n&#x27;ng’s leaders behind bars. Even some he didn’t catch
had grown so terrified of him that they too turned themselves in.

After five years of hunting, Norfleet had single-handedly destroyed the
country’s largest confederation of con artists. The efiort bankrupted him
and mined his marriage, but he died a satisfied man.
Interpretation
Most men accept the humiliation of being conned with a sense of resigna-
tion. They learn their lesson, recognizing that there is no such thing as a
free lunch, and that they have usually been brought down by their own
greed for easy money. Some, however, refuse to take their medicine. In
stead of reflecting on their own gullibility and avarice, they see themselves
as totally innocent victims.

Men like this may seem to be crusaders for justice and honesty, but
they are actually immoderately insecure. Being fooled, being conned, has
activated their self-doubt, and they are desperate to repair the damage.
Were the mortgage on N0rfleet’s ranch, the collapse of his marriage, and
the years of borrowing money and living in cheap hotels worth his revenge
over his embarrassment at being fleeced? To the Norfleets of the world,
overcoming their embarrassment is worth any price.

All people have insecurities, and often the best way to deceive a sucker
is to play upon his insecurities. But in the realm of power, everything is a
question of degree, and the person who is decidedly more insecure than
the average mortal presents great dangers. Be warned: If you practice de~
ception or trickery of any sort, study your mark well. Some people’s inse-
curity and ego fragility cannot tolerate the slightest offense. To see if you
are dealing with such a type, test them first—make, say, a mild joke at their
expense. A confident person will laugh; an overly insecure one will react as
if personally insulted. If you suspect you are dealing with this type, find an-
other victim.

Transgression III
In the fifth century B.C., Ch’ung-erh, the prince of Ch’in (in present-day
China), had been forced into exile. He lived modestly——even, sometimes,
in poverty—waiting for the time when he could return home and resume
his princely life. Once he was passing through the state of Cheng, where
the ruler, not knowing who he was, treated him rudely. The r1.1ler’s minis-
ter, Shu Chan, saw this and said, “This man is a worthy prince. May Your
Highness treat him with great courtesy and thereby place him under an
obligation!” But the ruler, able to see only the prince’s lowly station, ig-
nored this advice and insulted the prince again. Shu Chan again warned
his master, saying, “If Your Highness cannot treat Ch’ung~erh with cour-
tesy, you should put him to death, to avoid calamity in the future.” The
ruler only scoffed.

Years later, the prince was finally able to return home, his circum-
stances greatly changed. He did not forget who had been kind to him, and

LAW 19

I41

who had been insolent, during his years of poverty. Least of all did he for»
get his treatment at the hands of the ruler of Cheng. At his first opportunity
he assembled a vast army and marched on Chang, taking eight cities, de~
straying the kingdom, and sending the ruler into an exile of his own.
Interpretation
You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of little im-
portance and means today can be a person of power tomorrow. We forget
a lot in our lives, but we rarely forget an insult.

How was the ruler of Cheng to know that Prince Ch’ung-erh was an
ambitious, calculating, cunning type, a serpent with along memory? There
was really no way for him to know, you may say-—but since there was no
way, it would have been better not to tempt the fates by finding out. There
is nothing to be gained by insulting a person unnecessarily Swallow the
impulse to offend, even if the other person seems weak. The satisfaction is
meager compared to the danger that someday be or she will be in a posi
tion to hurt you.

Transgresskm IV
The year of 1920 had been a particularly bad one for American art dealers.
Big buyers«-«the robber-baron generation of the previous century-~were
getting to an age where they were dying off like flies, and no new million»
aires had emerged to take their place. Things were so bad that a number of
the major dealers decided to pool their resources, an unheard-of event,
since art dealers usually get along like cats and dogs.

Joseph Duveen, art dealer to the richest tycoons of America, was suf-
fering more than the others that year, so he decided to go along with this
alliance. The group now consisted of the five biggest dealers in the country.
Looking around for a new client, they decided that their last best hope was
Henry Ford, then the wealthiest man in America. Ford had yet to venture
into the art market, and he was such a big target that it made sense for them
to work together.

The dealers decided to assemble a list, “The 100 Greatest Paintings in
the World” (all of which they happened to have in stock), and to offer the
lot of them to Ford. With one purchase he could make himself the world’s
greatest collector. The consortium worked for weeks to produce a magnifi-
cent object: a three-volume set of books containing beautiful reproductions
of the paintings, as well as scholarly texts accompanying each picture. Next
they made a personal visit to Ford at his home in Dearborn, Michigan.
There they were surprised by the simplicity of his house: Mr. Ford was ob‘
viously an extremely unaffected man.

Ford received them in his study. Looking through the book, he ex-
pressed astonishment and delight. The excited dealers began imagining the
millions of dollars that would shortly flow into their coflers. Finally, how—
ever, Ford looked up from the book and said, “Gentlemen, beautiful books
like these, with beautiful colored pictures like these, must cost an awful
lot!” “But Mr. Ford!” exclaimed Duveen, “we don’t expect you to buy these

142 j LAW 19

books. We got them up especially for you, to show you the pictures. These
books are a present to you.” Ford seemed puzzled. “Gentlemen,” he said,
“it is extremely nice of you, but I really don’t see how I can accept a beau-
tiful, expensive present like this from strangers.” Duveen explained to Ford
that the reproductions in the books showed paintings they had hoped to
sell to him. Ford finally understood. “But gentlemen,” he exclaimed, “what
would I want with the original pictures when the ones right here in these
books are so beautiful?”

Interpretation
Joseph Duveen prided himself on studying his victims and clients in ad
Vance, figuring out their weaknesses and the peculiarities of their tastes be
fore he ever met them. He was driven by desperation to drop this tactic just
once, in his assault on Henry Ford. It took him months to recover from his
misjudgrnent, both mentally and monetarily. Ford was the unassuming
plain—ma.n type who just isn’t worth the bother. He was the incarnation of
those literal-minded folk who do not possess enough imagination to be de
ceived. From then on, Duveen saved his energies for the Mellons and Mor-
gans of the world——men crafty enough for him to entrap in his snares.

KEYS T() POWER
The ability to measure people and to know who you’re dealing with is the
most important skill of all in gathering and conserving power. Without it
you are blind: Not only will you offend the wrong people, you will choose
the Wrong types to work on, and will think you are flattering people when
you are actually insulting them. Before embarking on any move, take the
measure of your mark or potential opponent. Otherwise you will waste
time and make mistakes. Study people&#x27;s weaknesses, the chinks in their
armor, their areas of both pride and insecurity. Know their ins and outs be-
fore you even decide whether or not to deal with them.

Two final words of caution: First, in judging and measuring your oppo~
nent, never rely on your instincts. You will make the greatest mistakes of all
if you rely on such inexact indicators. Nothing can substitute for gathering
concrete knowledge. Study and spy on your opponent for however long it
takes; this will pay off in the long run.

Second, never trust appearances. Anyone with a serpent’s heart can
use a show of kindness to cloak it; a person who is blustery on the outside is
often really a coward. Learn to see through appearances and their contra-
dictions. Never trust the version that people give of themselves——it is ut-
terly unreliable.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
When Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne of England, in 1558, there
was much to-do about her finding a husband. The issue was debated in Par-
liament, and was a. main topic of conversation among Englishmen of all
classes; they often disagreed as to whom she should marry, but everyone
thought she should marry as soon as possible, for a queen must have a
king, and must bear heirs for the kingdom. The debates raged on for years.
Meanwhile the most handsome and eligible bachelors in the realm-Sir
Robert Dudley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter Ra.leigh———vied for Elizabetlfs
hand. She did not discourage them, but she seemed to be in no hurry, and
her hints as to which man might be her favorite often contradicted each
other. In 1566, Parliament sent a delegation to Elizabeth urging her to
marry before she was too old to bear children. She did not argue, nor did
she discourage the delegation, but she remained a virgin nonetheless.

The delicate game that Elizabeth played with her suitors slowly made
her the subject of innumerable sexual fantasies and the object of cultish
worship. The court physician, Simon Forman, used his diary to describe
his dreams of deflowering her. Painters represented her as Diana and other
goddesses. The poet Edmund Spenser and others wrote eulogies to the Vir-
gin Queen. She was referred to as “tha, wor1d’s Empresse,” “that virtuous
Virgo” who rules the world and sets the stars in motion. In conversation
with her, her many male suitors would employ bold sexual innuendo, a
dare that Elizabeth did not discourage. She did all she could to stir their in
terest and simultaneously keep them at bay.

Throughout Europe, kings and princes knew that a marriage with Eliz-
abeth would seal an alliance between England and any nation. The king of
Spain wooed her, as did the prince of Sweden and the archduke of Austria.
She politely refused them all.

The great diplomatic issue of Elizabetlfs day was posed by the revolt
of the Flemish and Dutch Lowlands, which were then possessions of Spain.
Should England break its alliance with Spain and choose France as its main
ally on the Continent, thereby encouraging Flemish and Dutch indepen-
dence? By 1570 it had come to seem that an alliance with France would be
England’s wisest course. France had two eligible men of noble blood, the
dukes of Anjou and Alencon, brothers of the French king. Would either of
them marry Elizabeth? Both had advantages, and Elizabeth kept the hopes
of both alive. The issue simmered for years. The duke of Anjou made sev-

M6 ?

LAW 20

eral visits to England, kissed Elizabeth in public, even called her by pet
names; she appeared to requite his affections. Meanwhile, as she flirted
with the two brothers, a treaty was signed that sealed peace between
France and England. By 1582 Elizabeth felt she could break off the
courtship. In the case of the duke of Anjou in particular, she did so with
great relief: For the sake of diplomacy she had allowed herself to be
courted by a man whose presence she could not stand and whom she
found physically repulsive. Once peace between France and England was
secure, she dropped the unctuous duke as politely as she could.

By this time Elizabeth was too old to bear children. She was accord-
ingly able to live the rest of her life as she desired, and she died the Virgin
Queen. She left no direct heir, but ruled through a period of incomparable
peace and cultural fertility.

“

Interpretation
Elizabeth had good reason not to marry: She had witnessed the mistakes of
Mary Queen of Scots, her cousin. Resisting the idea of being ruled by a
woman, the Scots expected Mary to many and marry wisely. To wed a for-
eigner would be unpopular; to favor any particular noble house would
open up terrible rivalries. In the end Mary chose Lord Damley, a Catholic.
In doing so she incurred the wrath of Scotland’s Protestants, and endless
turmoil ensued.

Elizabeth knew that marriage can often lead to a female ru1er’s undo-
ing: By marrying and committing to an alliance with one party or nation,
the queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her choosing, con~
flicts which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her into a futile war.
Also, the husband becomes the de facto ruler, and often tries to do away
with his wife the queen, as Darnley tried to get rid of Mary. Elizabeth
learned the lesson well. She had two goals as a ruler: to a‘ ‘old marriage and
to avoid war. She managed to combine these goals by Lnngling the possi-
bility of marriage in order to forge alliances. The moment she committed
to any single suitor would have been the moment she lost her power. She
had to emanate mystery and desirability, never discouraging anyone’s
hopes but never yielding.

Through this lifelong game of flirting and withdrawing, Elizabeth
dominated the country and every man who sought to conquer her. As the
center of attention, she was in control. Keeping her independence above
all, Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of worship.

KEYS &#x27;l‘(..) POWER
Since power depends greatly on appearances, you must learn the tricks
that will enhance your image. Refusing to commit to a person or group is
one of these, When you hold yourself back, you incur not anger but a kind

LAW 20

§

147

of respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make yourself un-
graspable, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the relationship, as
most people do. This aura of power only grows with time: As your reputa-
tion for independence grows, more and more people will come to desire
you, wanting to be the one who gets you to commit. Desire is like a virus: If
we see that someone is desired by other people, we tend to find this person
desirable too.

The moment you commit, the magic is gone. You become like every-
one else. People will try all kinds of underhanded methods to get you to
commit. They will give you gifts, shower you with favors, all to put you
under obligation. Encourage the attention, stimulate their interest, but do
not commit at any cost. Accept the gifts and favors if you so desire, but be
careful to maintain your inner aloofness, You cannot inadvertently allow
yourself to feel obligated to anyone.

Remember, though: The goal is not to put people off, or to make it seem
that you are incapable of commitment. Like the Virgin Queen, you need to
stir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility of having you.
You have to bend to their attention occasionally, then——but never too far:

The Greek soldier and statesman Alcibiades played this game to per-
fection. It was Alcibiades who inspired and led the massive Athenian at-
mada that invaded Sicily in 414 BC. When envious Athenians back home
tried to bring him down by accusing him of trumpedup charges, he de-
fected to the enemy, the Spartans, instead of facing a trial back home. Then,
after the Athenians were defeated at Syracuse, he left Sparta for Persia, even
though the power of Sparta was now on the rise. Now, however, both the
Athenians and the Spartans courted Alcibiades because of his influence
with the Persians; and the Pen tans showered him with honors because of
his power over the Athenians and the Spartans. He made promises to every
side but committed to none, and in the end he held all the cards.

If you aspire to power and influence, try the Alcibiades tactic: Put
yourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with the
promise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its enemy,
will pursue you as well. As each side vies for your attention, you will im-
mediately seem a person of great influence and desirability. More power
will accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to one side. To perfect
this tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free from emotional entan-
glements, and to view all those around you as pawns in your rise to the top.
You cannot let yourself become the lackey for any cause.

In the midst of the 1968 U.S. presidential election, Henry Kissinger
made a phone call to Richard Nixon’s team. Kissinger had been allied with
Nelson Rockefeller, who had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomina-
tion. Now Kissinger offered to supply the Nixon camp with valuable inside
information on the negotiations for peace in Vietnam that were then going
on in Paris. He had a man on the negotiating team keeping him informed of
the latest developments. The Nixon team gladly accepted his offer.

At the same time, however, Kissinger also approached the Democratic
nominee, Hubert Humphrey, and offered his aid. The Humphrey people

148

LAW 20

asked him for inside information on Nixon and he supplied it. “Look,”
Kissinger told Hurnphrey’s people, “I’ve hated Nixon for years.” In fact he
had no interest in either side. What he really wanted was what he got: the
promise of a high-level cabinet post from both Nixon and Humphrey.
Whichever man won the election, Kissingefs career was secure.

The winner, of course, was Nixon, and Kissinger duly went on to his
cabinet post. Even so, he was careful never to appear too much of a Nixon
man. When Nixon was reelected in 1972, men much more loyal to him
than Kissinger were fired. Kissinger was also the only Nixon high official to
survive Watergate and serve under the next president, Gerald Ford. By
maintaining a little distance he thrived in turbulent times.

Those who use this strategy often notice a strange phenomenon:
People who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in the
process, for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand back
find themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is powerful, and
everyone wants them on their side.

When Picasso, after early years of poverty, had become the most suc-
cessful aitist in the world, he did not commit himself to this dealer or that
dealer, although they now besieged him from all sides with attractive offers
and grand promises. Instead, he appeared to have no interest in their ser-
vices; this technique drove them wild, and as they fought over him his
prices only rose. When Henry Kissinger, as U.S. secretary of state, wanted
to reach détente with the Soviet Union, he made no concessions or concil-
iatory gestures, but courted China instead. This infuriated and also scared
the Soviets——-they were already politically isolated and feared further isola
tion if the United States and China, ,ca.me together. Kissinger’s move
pushed them to the negotiating table. The tactic has a parallel in seduction:
When you want to seduce a woman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first.
Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a challenge for
them to win your affections. As long as you imitate the wise Virgin Queen
and stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet of attention and desire.

ested and suppcwtive, but find a way to mnain neutral; let others do the
fighting while you stand back, watch and wait. When the fighting patties
am good and tired thvy will be ripe for the picking. You can make it a prac-
tice, in fact, to stir up quarrels between otherpeople, and then offer to medi-
ate, gaining power as the go-between.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the late fifteenth century, the strongest city~states in Italy-——Venice, Flo-
rence, Rome, and Milan~—-found themselves constantly squabbling. Hover-
ing above their struggles were the nations of France and Spain, ready to
grab whatever they could from the weakened Italian powers. And trapped
in the middle was the small state of Mantua, ruled by the young Duke
Gianfrancesco Gonzaga. Mantua was strategically located in northern
Italy, and it seemed only a matter of time before one of the powers swal-
lowed it up and it ceased to exist as an independent kingdom.

Gonzaga was a fierce warrior and a skilled commander of troops, and
he became a kind of mercenzuy general for whatever side paid him best. In
the year 1490, he married Isabella d’Este, daughter of the ruler of another
small Italian duchy, Ferrara. Since he now spent most of his time away
iron Mantua, it fell to Isabella to rule in his stead.

lsabellzfs first true test as ruler came in 1498, when King Louis XII of
France was preparing armies to attack Milan. In their usual perfidious fash«
ion, the Italian states immediately looked for ways to profit from Mila.n’s
difficulties. Pope Alexander VI promised not to intervene, thereby giving
the French carte blanche. The Venefians signaled that they would not help
Milan, either—and in exchange for this, they hoped the French would give
them Mantua. The ruler of Milan, Lodovico Sforza, suddenly found him-
self alone and abandoned. He turned to Isabella d’Este, one of his closest
friends (also rumored to be his lover), and begged her to persuade Duke
Gonzaga to come to his aid. Isabella tried, but her husband balked, for he
saw Sforza’s cause as hopeless. And so, in 1499, Louis swooped down on
Milan and took it with ease.

Isabella now faced a dilemma: If she stayed loyal to Lodovico, the
French would now move against her. But if, instead, she allied herself with
France, she would make enemies elsewhere in Italy, compromising Man-
tua once Louis eventually withdrew. And if she looked to Venice or Rome
for help, they would simply swallow up Mantua under the cloak of coming
to her aid. Yet she had to do something. The mighty king of France was
breathing down her neck: She decided to befxiend him, as she had be~
friended Lodovico Sforza before him——-with alluring gifts, witty, intelligent
letters, and the possibility of her company, for Isabella was famous as a
woman of incomparable beauty and charm.

In 1500 Louis invited Isabella to a great party in Milan to celebrate his
victory. Leonardo da Vinci built an enormous mechanical lion for the af-
fair: When the lion opened its mouth, it spewed fresh lilies, the symbols of
French royalty. At the party Isabella wore one of her celebrated dresses
(she had by far the largest wardrobe of any of the Italian princesses), and
just as she had hoped, she charmed and captivated Louis, who ignored all
the other ladies vying for his attention. She soon became his constant com-
panion, and in exchange for her friendship he pledged to protect Mantua’s
independence from Venice.

As one danger receded, however, another, more worrying one arose,
this time from the south, in the form of Cesare Borgia Starting in 1500,
Borgia had marched steadily northward, gobbling up all the small king-
doms in his path in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. Isabella under»
stood Cesare perfectly: He could be neither tnisted 1101&#x27;
in any way
offended. He had to be cajoled and kept at arm’s length. Isabella began by
sending him gifts——falcons, prize dogs, perfumes, and dozens of masks,
which she knew he always wore when he walked the streets of Rome. She
sent messengers with flattering greetings (although these messengers also
acted as her spies). At one point Cesare asked if he could house some
troops in Mantua; Isabella managed to dissuade him politely, knowing full
well that once the troops were quartered in the city, they would never
leave.

Even while Isabella was charming Cesare, she convinced everyone
around her to take care never to utter a harsh word about him, since he
had spies everywhere and would use the slightest pretext for invasion.
When Isabella had a child, she asked Cesare to be the godfather. She even
dangled in front of him the possibility of a marriage between her family
and his. Somehow it all worked, for although elsewhere he seized every-
thing in his path, he spared Mantua.

In 1503 Cesare’s father, Alexander, died, and a few years later the new
pope, Julius II, went to war to drive the French troops from Italy. When
the ruler of Fe1rara——Alfonso, Isabella’s brother—sided with the French,
Julius decided to attack and humble him. Once again Isabella found herself
in the middle: the pope on one side, the French and her brother on the
other. She dared not ally herself with either, but to offend either would be
equally disastrous. Again she played the double game at which she had be-
come so expert. On the one hand she got her husband Gonzaga to fight for
the pope, knowing he would not fight very hard. On the other she let
French troops pass through Mantua to come to Ferrara’s aid. While she
publicly complained that the French had “invaded” her territory, she pri-
vately supplied them with valuable information. To make the invasion
plausible to Julius, she even had the French pretend to plunder Mantua. It
worked once again: The pope left Mantua alone.

In 1513, after a lengthy siege, Julius defeated Ferrara, and the French
troops withdrew. Worn out by the effort, the pope died a few months later.
With his death, the nightmarish cycle of battles and petty squabbles began
to repeat itself.

A great deal changed in Italy during Isabella’s reign: Popes came and
went, Cesare Borgia rose and then fell, Venice lost its empire, Milan was in
vaded, Florence fell into decline, and Rome was sacked by the Hapsburg
Emperor Charles V. Through all this, tiny Mantua not only survived but
thrived, its court the envy of Italy. Its wealth and sovereignty would remain
intact for a century after Isabella’s death, in 1539.

Interpretation
Isabella d’Este understood Italy’s political situation with amazing clarity:
Once you took the side of any of the forces in the field, you were doomed.
The powerful would take you over, the weak would wear you down. Any
new alliance would lead to a new enemy, and as this cycle stirred up more
conflict, other forces would be dragged in, until you could no longer extri-
cate yourself. Eventually you would collapse from exhaustion.

Isabella steered her kingdom on the only course that would bring her
safely through. She would not allow herself to lose her head through loy~
alty to a duke or a king. Nor would she try to stop the conflict that raged
around her---that would only drag her into it. And in any case the conflict
was to her advantage. If die various parties were fighting to the death, and
exhausting themselves in the process, they were in no position to gobble
up Mantua. The source of Isabella’s power was her clever ability to seem
interested in the affairs and interests of each side, while actually commib
ting to no one but herself and her kingdom.

Once you step into a. fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all
interests become your interests; you become
initiative. The combatants’
their tool. Learn to control yourself, to restrain your natural tendency to
take sides and join the fight. Be friendly and charming to each of the com~
batants, then step back as they collide. V/Wth every battle they grow weaker,
while you grow stronger with every battle you avoid.

KEYS TO POWER
To succeed in the game of power, you have to master your emotions. But
even if you succeed in gaining such self-control, you can never control the
temperamental dispositions of those around you. And this presents a great
danger. Most people operate in a whirlpool of emotions, constantly react‘
ing, churning up squabbles and conflicts. Your sell’—contIol and autonomy
will only bother and infuriate them. They will my to draw you into the
whirlpool, begging you to take sides in their endless battles, or to make
peace for them. If you succumb to their emotional entreaties, little by little
you will find your mind and time occupied by their problems. Do not allow
whatever compassion and pity you possess to suck you in. You can never
win in this game; the conflicts can only multiply.

On the other hand, you cannot completely stand aside, for that would

cause needless offense. To play the game properly, you must seem inter-
ested in other people‘s problems, even sometimes appear to take their side.
But while you make outward gestures of support, you must maintain your
inner energy and sanity by keeping your emotions disengaged. No matter
how hard people try to pull you in, never let your interest in their affairs
and petty squabbles go beyond the surface. Give them gifts, listen with a
sympathetic look, even occasionally play the charmer-—but inwardly keep
both the friendly kings and the perfidious Borgias at arm’s length. By refus~
ing to commit and thus maintaining your autonomy you retain the initia-
tive: Your moves stay matters of your own choosing, not defensive
reactions to the push-and~pu1l of those around you.

Slowness to pick up your weapons can be a weapon itself, especially if
you let other people exhaust themselves fighting, then take advantage of
their exhaustion. In ancient China, the kingdom of Chin once invaded the
kingdom of Hsing. Huan, the ruler of a nearby province, thought he
should rush to Hsing’s defense, but his adviser counseled him to wait:
“Hsing is not yet going to ruin,” he said, “and Chin is not yet exhausted. If
Chin is not exhausted, [we] cannot become very influential. Moreover, the
merit of supporting a state in danger is not as great as the virtue of reviving
a ruined one.” The adviser’s argument won the day, and as he had pre-
dicted, Huan later had the glory both of rescuing Hsing from the brink of
destruction and then of conquering an exhausted Chin. He stayed out of
the fighting until the forces engaged in it had worn each other down, at
which point it was safe for him to intervene.

That is what holding back from the fray allows you: time to position
yourselfto take advantage of the situation once one side starts to lose. You
can also take the game a step further, by promising your support to both
sides in a conflict while maneuvering so that the one to come out ahead in
the struggle is you. This was whatCastn1ccio Castracani, ruler of the Italian
town of Lucca in the fourteenth century, did when he had designs on the
town of Pistoia. A siege would have been expensive, costing both lives and
money, but Castruccio knew that Pistoia contained two rival factions, the
Blacks and the Whites, which hated one another. He negotiated with the
Blacks, promising to help them against the Whites; then, without their
knowledge, he promised the Whites he would help them against
the
Blacks. And Castruccio kept his promiseswhe sent an army to a Black-
controlled gate to the city, which the sentxies of course welcomed in.
Meanwhile another of his armies entered through a White—control1ed gate.
The two armies united in the middle, occupied the town, killed the leaders
of both factions, ended the internal war, and took Pistoia for Castruccio.

Preserving your autonomy gives you options when people come to
blows—~you can play the mediator, broker the peace, while really securing
your own interests. You can pledge support to one side and the other may
have to court you with a higher bid. Or, like Castruccio, you can appear to
take both sides, then play the antagonists against each other.

Dftentimes when a conflict breaks out, you are tempted to side with
the stronger party, or the one that offers you apparent advantages in an al-

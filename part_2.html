    <pre>have a strong enough sense of your own worth to enjoy a good laugh at

It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation.
Friedrirh /Vietzsrhrc, 18-44—I 900

KEYS TO POWER
The people around us, even our closest friends, will always to some extent
remain mysterious and unfathomable. Their characters have secret recesses
that they never reveal. The unknowableness of other people could prove
disturbing if we thought about it long enough, since it would make it im-
possible for us really to judge other people. So we prefer to ignore this fact,
and to judge people on their appearances, on what is most visible to our
eyes—-clothes, gestures, words, actions. In the social realm, appearances are
the barometer of almost all of our judgments, and you must never be nus-
led into believing otherwise. One false slip, one awkward or sudden change
in your appearance, can prove disastrous.

This is the reason for the supreme importance of making and main-

taining a reputation that is of your own creation.

That reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of appear-
ances, distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what you are
really like, and giving you a degree of control over how the world judges
you—a powerful position to be in. Reputation has a power like magic:
With one stroke of its wand, it can double your strength. It can also send
people scurrying away from you. Whether the exact same deeds appear
brilliant or dreadful can depend entirely on the reputation of the deer.

In the ancient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man
named Mi Tzu-hsia who had a reputation for supreme civility and gracious-
ness. He became the mler’s favorite. It was a law in Wei that “whoever
rides secretly in the ruler’s coach shall have his feet cut off,” but when Mi
Tzu-hsia’s mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit her, pretending
that the ruler had given him permission. When the ruler found out, he said,
“How dutiful is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother’s sake he even forgot that he
was committing a crime making him liable to lose his feet!”

Another time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-hsia
began eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the ruler the
other half to eat. The ruler remarked, “You love me so much that you would
even forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest of the peach!”

Later, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi Tzu-
hsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging his reputa-
tion; the ruler came to see his actions in a new light “This fellow once rode
in my coach under pretense of my order,” he told the courtiers angrily,
“and another time he gave me a half-eaten peach.” For the same actions
that had charmed the ruler when he was the favorite, Mi Tzu-hsia now had
to suffer the penalties. The fate of his feet depended solely on the strength
of his reputation.

In the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one out-
standing quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This quality
sets you apart and gets other people to talk about you. You then make your
reputation known to as many people as possible (subtly, though; take care
to build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like
wildfire.

A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your
strengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also create an
aura around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in the
North African desert during World War II, the German general Erwin
Rommel had a reputation for cunning and for deceptive maneuvering that
struck terror into everyone who faced him. Even when his forces were de-
pleted, and when British tanks outnumbered his by five to one, entire cities
would be evacuated at the news of his approach.

As they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires
respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene,
or utter a single word.

Your success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the suc-

LAW 5

41

cess of Henry Kissinger‘s shuttle diplomacy rested on his reputation for
ironing out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so unreasonable that
Kissinger could not sway him. A peace treaty seemed a fait accompli as
soon as Kissinger’s name became involved in the negotiations.

Make your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality. This
single quality—-efiiciency, say, or seductiveness-—becomes a kind of calling
card that announces your presence and places others under a spell. A repu-
tation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception.
Casanova used his reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his fu-
ture conquests; women who had heard of his powers became immensely
curious, and wanted to discover for themselves what had made him so ro-
mantically successful.

Perhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are pre-
vented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate
with someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name
to whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputa-
tion for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. ‘Nixon
P. T. Barnum wanted to clean up a reputation for promoting vulgar enter-
tainment, he brought the singer jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a
stellar, high—class reputation, and the American tour Bamum sponsored for
her greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons of
nineteentlrcentury America were long unable to rid themselves of a repu-
tation for cruelty and mean-spiritedness. Only when they began collecting
art, so that the names of Morgan and Frick became permanently associated
with those of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften their un-
pleasant image.

Reputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Espe-
cially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, antici-
pating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or
defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies—that reveals inse-
curity, not confidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and
never appear desperate in your self—defense. On the other hand, an attack
on another man’s reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you
have less power than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle,
and your own thus~far-small reputation gives him a. small target when he
tries to return your fire. Bamum used such campaigns to geat effect in his
early career. But this tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem
to engage in petty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy’s reputation
cleverly, you will inadvertently ruin your own.

Thomas Edison, considered the inventor who harnessed electricity,
believed that a workable system would have to be based on direct cur-
rent (DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared to have suc-
ceeded in creating a system based on alternating current (AC), Edison was
furious. He determined to ruin Tesla’s reputation, by making the public be-
lieve that the AC system was inherently unsafe, and Tesla irresponsible in
promoting it.

To this end he captured all kinds of household pets and electrocuted

42

LAW 5

them to death with an AC current. When this wasn’t enough, in 1890 he got
New York State prison authorities to organize the world’s first execution by
electrocution, using an AC current. But Edison’s electrocution experiments
had all been with small creatures; the charge was too weak, and the man
was only half killed. In perhaps the country’s cruelest state-authorized exe
cufion, the procedure had to be repeated. It was an awful spectacle.

Although, in the long run, it is Edison’s name that has survived, at the
time his campaign damaged his own reputation more than Tesla’s. He
backed off. The lesson is simple-—never go too far in attacks like these, for
that will draw more attention to your own vengefulness than to the person
you are slandering. When your own reputation is solid, use subtler tactics,
such as satire and ridicule, to weaken your opponent while making you out
as a charming rogue. The mighty lion toys with the mouse that crosses his
path—any other reaction would mar his fearsome reputation.

REVERSAL
There is no possible Reversal. Reputation is critical; there are no excep-
tions to this law. Perhaps, not caring what others think of you, you gain a
reputation for insolence and arrogance, but that can be a valuable image in
itself—0scar Wilde used it to great advantage. Since we must live in soci-
ety and must depend on the opinions of others, there is nothing to be
gained by neglecting your reputation. By not caring how you are per»
ceived, you let others decide this for you. Be the master of your fate, and
also of your reputation.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAVV
P. T. Barnum, America’s premier nineteenth-century showman, started his
career as an assistant to the owner of a circus, Aaron Turner. In 1836 the
circus stopped in Annapolis, Maryland, for a series of performances. On
the morning of opening day, Barnum took a stroll through town, wearing a
new black suit. People started to follow him. Someone in the gathering
crowd shouted out that he was the Reverend Ephraim K. Avery, infamous
as a man acquitted of the charge of murder but still believed guilty by most
Americans. The angry mob tore off Bamum’s suit and was ready to lynch
him. After desperate appeals, Barnum finally convinced them to follow
him to the circus, where he could verify his identity.

Once there, old Turner confirmed that this was all a practical joke-—he
himself had spread the rumor that Barnum was Avery. The crowd dis—
persed, but Barnum, who had nearly been killed, was not amused. He
wanted to know what could have induced his boss to play such a trick. “My
dear Mr. Barnum,” Turner replied, “it was all for our good. Remember, all
we need to ensure success is notoriety.” And indeed everyone in town was
talking about the joke, and the circus was packed that night and every night
it stayed in Annapolis. Barnum had learned a lesson he would never forget.
Bamum‘s first big venture of his own was the American Museum——a
collection of curiosities,
located in New York. One day a beggar ap-
proached Bamum in the street. Instead of giving him money, Bamum de-
cided to employ him. Taking him back to the museum, he gave the man
live bricks and told him to make a slow circuit of several blocks. At certain
points he was to lay down a brick on the sidewalk, always keeping one
brick in hand. On the return journey he was to replace each brick on the
street with the one he held. Meanwhile he was to remain serious of counte-
nance and to answer no questions. Once back at the museum, he was to
enter, walk around inside, then leave through the back door and make the
same bricklaying circuit again.

On the man’s first walk through the streets, several hundred people
watched his mysterious movements. By his fourth circuit, onlookers
swarmed around him, debating what he was doing. Every time he entered
the museum he was followed by people who bought tickets to keep watch»
ing him. Many of them were distracted by the museum’s collections, and
stayed inside. By the end of the first day, the brick man had drawn over a

thousand people into the museum. A few days later the police ordered him
to cease and desist from his walks——the crowds were blocking traffic. The
bricklaying stopped but thousands of New Yorkers had entered the mu-
seum, and many of those had become P. T. Barnum converts.

Barnum would put a band of musicians on a balcony overlooking the
street, beneath a huge banner proclaiming FREE MUSIC FOR THE MILLIONS.
What generosity, New Yorkers thought, and they flocked to hear the free
concerts. But Barnum took pains to hire the worst musicians he could find,
and soon afier the band struck up, people would hurry to buy tickets to the
museum, where they would be out of earshot of the band’s noise, and of
the booing of the crowd.

One of the first oddities Barnum toured around the country wasjoice
Heth, a woman he claimed was 161 years old, and whom he advertised as a
slave who had once been George Washington’s nurse. After several
months the crowds began to dwindle, so Barnum sent an anonymous letter
to the papers, claiming that Heth was a clever fraud. ‘joice Heath,” he
wrote, “is not a human being but an automaton, made up of whalebone,
indie-rubber, and numberless springs.” Those who had not bothered to see
her before were immediately curious, and those who had already seen her
paid to see her again, to find out whether the rumor that she was a robot
was true.

In 1842, Barnum purchased the carcass of what was purported to be a
mermaid. This creature resembled a monkey with the body of a fish, but
the head and body were perfectly joined—it was truly a wonder. After
some research Barnum discovered that the creature had been expertly put
together injapan, where the hoax had caused quite a stir.

He nevertheless planted articles in newspapers around the country
claiming the capture of a mermaid in the Fiji Islands. He also sent the pa—
pers woodcut prints of paintings showing mermaids. By the time he showed
the specimen in his museum, a national debate had been sparked over the
existence of these mythical creatures. A few months before Batnum’s cam~
paign, no one had cared or even known about mermaids; now everyone
was talking about them as if they were real. Crowds flocked in record num»
bers to see the Fiji Mermaid, and to hear debates on the subject.

A few years later, Barnum toured Europe with General Tom Thumb. a
five-year—old dwarf from Connecticut whom Bamum claimed was an
elevenvyear-old English boy, and whom he had trained to do many re-
markable acts. During this tour Bamum’s name attracted such attention
that Queen Victoria, that paragon of sobriety, requested a private audience
with him and his talented dwarf at Buckingham Palace. The English press
may have ridiculed Bamum, but Victoria was royally entertained by him,
and respected him ever after.

Interpretation
Barnum understood the fundamental
truth about attracting attention:
Once people’s eyes are on you, you have a special legitimacy. For Barnum,

creating interest meant creating a crowd; as he later wrote, “Every crowd
has a silver lining.” And crowds tend to act in conjunction. If one person
stops to see your beggarman laying bricks in the street, more will do the
same. They will gather like dust bunnies. Then, given a gentle push, they
will enter your museum or watch your show. To create a crowd you have to
do something different and odd. Any kind of curiosity will serve the pur-
pose, for crowds are magnetically attracted by the unusual and inexplica-
ble. And once you have their attention, never let it go. If it veers toward
other people, it does so at your expense. Barnum would ruthlessly suck at~
tention from his competitors, knowing what a valuable commodity it is.

At the beginning of your rise to the top, then, spend all your energy on
attracting attention. Most important: The quality of the attention is irrele
vant. No matter how badly his shows were reviewed, or how slanderously
personal were the attacks on his hoaxes, Barnum would never complain. If
a newspaper critic reviled him particularly badly, in fact, he made sure to
invite the man to an opening and to give him the best seat in the house. He
would even write anonymous attacks on his own work, just to keep his
name in the papers. From Bamum’s vantage, attentionwwhether negative
or positive——was the main ingredient of his success. The worst fate in the
world for a man who yearns fame, glory, and, of course, power is to be
ignored.

KEYS TO POWER
Burning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born
with. You have to learn to attract attention, “as surely as the lodestone at~
tracts iron.” At the start of your career, you must attach your name and rep-
utation to a quality, an image, that sets you apart from other people. This
image can be something like a characteristic style of dress, or a personality
quirk that amuses people and gets talked about. Once the image is estalr
lished, you have an appearance, a place in the sky for your star.

It is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance of
yours should not be controversial, that to be attacked is somehow bad.
Nothing could be further from the truth. To avoid being a flash in the pan,
and having your notoriety eclipsed by another, you must not discriminate
between different types of attention; in the end, every kind will work in
your favor. Barnum, we have seen, welcomed personal attacks and felt
no need to defend himself. He deliberately courted the image of being a
humbug.

The court of Louis XIV contained many talented writers, artists, great
beauties, and men and women of impeccable virtue, but no one was more
talked about than the singular Due de Lauzun. The duke was short, almost
dwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of behavior-—he
slept with the king’s mistress, and openly insulted not only other courtiers
but the king himself. Louis, however, was so beguiled by the duke’s eccen~
tricities that he could not beat his absences from the court. It was simple:
The strangeness of the duke’s character attracted attention. Once people
were enthralled by him, they wanted him around at any cost.

Society craves larger-than-life figures, people who stand above the
general mediocrity. Never be afraid, then, of the qualities that set you apart
and draw attention to you. Court controversy, even scandal. It is better to
be attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions are ruled by this
law, and all professionals must have a bit of the showman about them.

The great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he had to
remain in the public eye at any cost. Almost as important as the inventions
themselves was how he presented them to the public and courted attention.
Edison would design w&#x27;sual1y dazzling experiments to display his dis~
coveries with electricity. He would talk of future inventions that seemed
the time-—robots, and machines that could photograph
fantastic at
thought—-and that he had no intention of wasting his energy on, but that
made the public talk about him. He did everything he could to make sure
that he received more attention than his great rival Nikola Tesla, who may
actually have been more brilliant than he was but whose name was far less
known. In 1915, it was rumored that Edison and Tesla would be joint recip-
ients of that year’s Nobel Prize in physics. The prize was eventually given to
a pair of English physicists; only later was it discovered that the prize com-
mittee had actually approached Edison, but he had turned them down, re-v
fusing to share the prize with Tesla. By that time his fame was more secure
than Tesla’s, and he thought it better to refuse the honor than to allow his
rival the attention that would have come even from sharing the prize.

If you find yourself in a lowly position that offers little opportunity for
you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack the most visible, most
famous, most powerful person you can find. When Pietro Aretino, a young
Roman servant boy of the early sixteenth century, wanted to get attention
as a writer of verses, he decided to publish a series of satirical poems rid}
culing the pope and his affection for a pet elephant. The attack put Aretino
in the public eye immediately. A slanderous attack on a person in a posi-
tion of power would have a similar effect. Remember, however, to use such
tactics sparingly after you have the public’s attention, when the act can
wear thin.

Once in the limelight you must constantly renew it by adapting and
varying your method of courting attention. If you don’t, the public will
grow tired, will take you for granted, and will move on to a newer star. The
game requires constant vigilance and creativity. Pablo Picasso never al
lowed himself to fade into the background; if his name became too at

tached to a particular style, he would deliberately upset the public with a
new series of paintings that went against all expectations. Better to create
something ugly and disturbing, he believed, than to let viewers grow too fa-
miliar with his work. Understand: People feel superior to the person whose
actions they can predict. If you show them who is in control by playing
against their expectations, you both gain their respect and lighten your hold
on dreir fleeting attention.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Beginning in 1905, rumors started to spread throughout Paris of a young
Oriental girl who danced in a private home, wrapped in veils that she grad-
ually discarded. A local journalist who had seen her dancing reported that
“a woman from the Far East had come to Europe laden with perfume and
jewels, to introduce some of the richness of the Oriental colour and iife into
the satiated society of European cities.” Soon everyone knew the dam:er’s
name: Mata Han‘.

Early that year, in the winter, small and select audiences would gather
in a salon filled with Indian statues and other relics while an orchestra
played music inspired by Hindu and Javanese melodies. After keeping the
audience waiting and wondering, Mata Hari would suddenly appear, in a
startling costume: a white cotton brassiere covered with India.n~type jewels;
jeweled bands at the waist supporting a sarong that revealed as much as it
concealed; bracelets up the arms. Then Mata Hari would dance, in a style
no one in France had seen before, her whole body swaying as if she were in
a trance. She told her excited and curious audience that her dances told
stories from Indian mythology and javanese folktales. Soon the cream of
Paris, and ambassadors from far—off lands, were competing for invitations
to the salon, where it was rumored that Mata. Hari was actually performing
sacred dances in the nude.

The public wanted to know more about her. She told journalists that
she was actually Dutch in origin, but had grown up on the island ofjava.
She would also talk about time spent in India, how she had learned sacred
Hindu dances there, and how Indian women “can shoot straight, ride
horseback, and are capable of doing logarithms and talk philosophy.” By
the summer of 1905, although few Parisians had actually seen Mata Hari
dance, her name was on everyone’s lips.

As Mata Hari gave more interviews, the story of her origins kept
changing: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the daughter
of ajavanese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra where she
had spent her time “horsebaxzk riding, gun in hand, and risking her life.”
No one knew
certain about her, butjournalists did not mind these
changes in her biography. They compared her to an Indian goddess, a
creature from the pages of Baudelaire—whatever their imagination wanted
to see in this mysterious woman from the East.

In August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in public.

Crowds thronging to see her on opening night caused a riot. She had now
become a cult figure, spawning many imitations. One reviewer wrote,
“Mata Hari personifies all the poetry of India, its mysticism, its voluptuous-
ness, its hypnotizing charm.” Another noted, “If India possesses such unex-
pected treasures, then all Frenchmen will emigrate to the shores of the
Ganges.”

Soon the fame of Mata Hari and her sacred Indian dances spread be-
yond Paris. She was invited to Berlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next few
years she performed throughout Europe, mixed with the highest social cir-
cles, and earned an income that gave her an independence rarely enjoyed
by a woman of the period. Then, near the end of World War I, she was ar-
rested in France, tried, convicted, and finally executed as a German spy.
Only during the trial did the truth come out: Mata Hari was not from java
or India, had not grown up in the Orient, did not have a drop of Eastern
blood in her body. Her real name was Margaretha Zelle, and she came
from the stolid northern province of Friesland, Holland.

Interpretation
When Margaretha Zelle arrived in Paris, in 1904, she had half a franc in
her pocket. She was one of the thousands of beautiful young girls who
flocked to Paris every year,
taking work as artists’ models, nightclub
dancers, or vaudeville performers at the Folies Bergére. After a few years
they would inevitably be replaced by younger girls, and would often end
up on the streets, turning to prostitution, or else returning to the town they
came from, older and chastened.

Zelle had higher ambitions. She had no dance experience and had
never performed in the theater, but as a young girl she had traveled with
her family and had witnessed local dances in Java and Sumatra. Zelle
clearly understood that what was important in her act was not the dance it-
self, or even her face or figure, but her ability to create an air of mystery
about herself. The mystery she created lay not just in her dancing, or her
costumes, or the stories she would tell, or her endless lies about her origins;
it lay in an atmosphere enveloping everything she did. There was nothing
you could say for sure about her——she was always changing, always sur-
prising her audience with new costumes, new dances, new stories. This air
of mystery left the public always wanting to know more, always wondering
about her next move. Mata Hari was no more beautiful than many of the
other young girls who came to Paris, and she was not a particularly good
dancer. What separated her from the mass, what attracted and held the
public’s attention and made her famous and wealthy, was her mystery.
People are enthralled by mystery; because it invites constant interpreta-
tion, they never tire of it. The mysterious cannot be grasped. And what
cannot be seized and consumed creates power.

KEYS TO POWER
In the past, the world was filled with the terrifying and unknowable—
diseases, disasters, capricious despots, the mystery of death itself. What we
could not understand we reimagined as myths and spirits. Over the cen-
turies, though, we have managed, through science and reason, to illumi-
nate the darkness; what was mysterious and forbidding has grown familiar
and comfortable. Yet this light has a price: in a world that is ever more
banal, that has had its mystery and myth squeezed out of it, we secretly
crave enigmas, people or things that cannot be instantly interpreted,
seized, and consumed.

That is the power of the mysterious: It invites layers of interpretation,
excites our imagination, seduces us into believing that it conceals some-
thing marvelous. The world has become so familiar and its inhabitants so
predictable that what wraps itself in mystery will almost always draw the
limelight to it and make us watch it.

Do not imagine that to create an air of mystery you have to be grand
and awe~inspirlng. Mystery that is woven into your day-to-day demeanor,
and is subtle, has that much more power to fascinate and attract attention.
Remember: Most people are upfront, can be read like an open book, take
little care to control their words or image, and are hopelessly predictable.
By simply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering arnbiguous
phrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, and acting odd in tlie subtlest
of ways, you will emanate an aura of mystery. The people around you will
then magnify that aura by constantly dying to interpret you.

Both artists and con artists understand the vital link between being
mysterious and attracting interest. Count Victor Lustig, the aristocrat of
swindlers, played the game to perfection. He was always doing things that
were different, or seemed to make no sense. He would show up at the best
hotels in a limo driven by ajapanese chauffeur; no one had ever seen a
Japanese chauffeur before, so this seemed exotic and strange. Lustig would
dress in the most expensive clothing, but always with something—a medal,
a flower, an arrnband—out of place, at least in conventional terms. This
was seen not as tasteless but as odd and intriguing. In hotels he would be
seen receiving telegrams at all hours, one afier the other, brought to him by
his Japanese chauffeur—telegrams he would tear up with utter noncha-
lance. (In fact they were fakes, completely blank.) He would sit alone in the
dining room, reading a large and impressive-looking book, smiling at peo-
ple yet remaining aloof. Vlfithin a few days, of course,
the entire hotel
would be abuzz with interest in this strange man.

All this attention allowed Lustig to lure suckers in with ease. They
would beg for his confidence and his company. Everyone wanted to be
seen with this mysterious aristocrat. And in the presence of this distracting
enigma, they wouldn’t even notice that they were being robbed blind.

An air of mystery can make the mediocre appear intelligent and pro-
found. It made Mata Hari, a woman of average appearance and intelli-
gence, seem like a goddess, and her dancing divinely inspired. An air of

52

LAW 6

mystery about an artist makes his or her artwork immediately more intrigu-
ing, a trick Marcel Duchamp played to great effect. It is all very easy to
clo—-say little about your work, tease and titillate with alluring, even contra~
dictory comments, then stand back and let others try to make sense of it all.
Mysterious people put others in a kind of inferior position—-that of try-
ing to figure them out. To degrees that they can control, they also elicit the
fear surrounding anything uncertain or unknown. All great leaders know
that an aura of mystery draws attention to them and creates an intimidating
presence. Mao Tse-rung, for example, cleverly cultivated an enigmatic
image; he had no worries about seeming inconsistent or contradicting him~
self-—fl1e very contradictoriness of his actions and words meant that he a.l~
ways had the upper hand. No one, not even his own wife, ever felt they
understood him, and he therefore seemed larger than life. This also meant
that the public paid constant attention to him, ever anxious to witness his
next move.

If your social position prevents you from completely wrapping your
actions in mystery, you must at least learn to make yourself less obvious.
Every now and then, act in a way that does not mesh with other people’s
perception of you. This way you keep those around you on the defensive,
eliciting the kind of attention that makes you powerful. Done right, the ore
ation of enigma. can also draw the kind of attention that strikes terror into
your enemy.

During the Second Punic War (219402 13.0.), the great Carthaginian
general Hannibal was wreaking havoc in his march on Rome. Hannibal
was known for his cleverness and duplicity.

Under his leadership Carthage’s army, though smaller than those of
the Romans, had constantly outmaneuvered them. On one occasion,
though, Hann1‘bal’s scouts made a horrible blunder, leading his troops into
a marshy terrain with the sea at their back. The Roman army blocked the
mountain passes that led inland, and its general, Fabius, was ecstatic-at
last he had Hannibal trapped. Posting his best sentries on the passes, he
worked on a plan to destroy Hannibal’s forces. But in the middle of the
night, the sentries looked down to see a mysterious sight: A huge proces-
sion of lights was heading up the mountain. Thousands and thousands of
lights. If this was Hannibal’s army, it had suddenly grown a hundredfold.

The sentries argued heatedly about what this could mean: Reinforce-
ments from the sea? Troops that had been hidden in the area? Ghosts? No
explanation made sense.

As they watched, fires broke out all over the mountain, and a horrible
noise drified up to them from below, like the blowing of a million horns.
Demons, they thought. The sentries, the bravest and most sensible in the
Roman army, fled their posts in a panic.

By the next day, Hannibal had escaped from the marshland. What was
his trick? Had he really conjured up demons? Actually what he had done
was order bundles of twigs to be fastened to the horns of the thousands of
oxen that traveled with his troops as beasts of burden. The twigs were then

LAW6 3 53

lit, giving the impression of the torches of a vast army heading up the
mountain. When the flames burned down to the oxen’s skin, they stam-
peded in all directions, bellowing like mad and setting fires all over the
mountainside. The key to this device’s success was not the torches, the
fires, or the noises in themselves, however, but the fact that Hannibal had
created a puzzle that captivated the sentries’ attention and gradually terri-
fied them. From the mountaintop there was no way to explain this bizarre
sight. If the sentries could have explained it they would have stayed at their
posts.

If you find yourself trapped, cornered, and on the defensive in some
situation, try a simple experiment: Do something that cannot be easily ex-
plained or interpreted. Choose a simple action, but carry it out in a way
that unsettles your opponent, a way with many possible interpretations,
making your intentions obscure. Don’t just be unpredictable (although this
tactic too can be successful—see Law 17); like Hannibal, create a scene that
cannot be read. There will seem to be no method to your madness, no
rhyme or reason, no single explanation. If you do this right, you will in-
spire fear and trembling and the sentries will abandon their posts. Call it
the “feigned madness of Hamlet” tactic, for Hamlet uses it to great effect in
Shakespeare‘s play, frightening his stepfather Claudius through the mys-
tery of his behavior. The mysterious makes your forces seem larger, your
power more terrifying.

LAW 6

R EV F. RSAL

In the beginning of your rise to the top, you must attract attention at all
cost, but as you rise higher you must constantly adapt. Never wear the pub-
lic out with the same tactic. An air of mystery works wonders for those who
need to develop an aura of power and get themselves noticed, but it must
seem measured and under control. Mata Hari went too far with her fabri-
cations; although the accusation that she was a spy was false, at the time it
was a reasonable presumption because all her lies made her seem suspi-
cious and nefarious. Do not let your air of mystery be slowly transformed
into a reputation for deceit. The mystery you create must seem a game,
playful and unthreatening. Recognize when it goes too far, and pull back.

There are times when the need for attention must be deferred, and
when scandal and notoriety are the last things you want to create. The at-
tention you attract must never offend or challenge the reputation of those
above you—not, at any rate, if they are secure. You will seem not only pal-
try but desperate by comparison. There is an art to knowing when to draw
notice and when to withdraw.

Lola Montez was one of the great practitioners of the art of attracting
attention. She managed to rise from a middle—class Irish background to
being the lover of Franz Liszt and then the mistress and political adviser of
King Ludwig of Bavaria. In her later years, though, she lost her sense of
proportion.

In London in 1850 there was to be a performance of Shakespeare’s
Macbeth featuring the greatest actor of the time, Charles john Kean. Every-
one of consequence in English society was to be there; it was rumored that
even Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were to make a public appearance.
The custom of the period demanded that everyone be seated before the
queen anived. So the audience got there a little early, and when the queen
entered her royal box, they observed the convention of standing up and
applauding her. The royal couple waited, then bowed. Everyone sat down
and the lights were dimmed. Then, suddenly, all eyes turned to a box op-
posite Queen Victoria’s: A woman appeared from the shadows, taking her
seat later than the queen. It was Lola Montez. She wore a diamond tiara on
her dark hair and a long fur coat over her shoulders. People whispered in
amazement as the ermine cloak was dropped to reveal a low-necked gown
of crimson velvet. By turning their heads, the audience could see that the
royal couple deliberately avoided looking at Lola’s box. They followed
Victoria’s example, and for the rest of the evening Lola Montez was ig-
nored. After that evening no one in fashionable society dared to be seen
with her. All her magnetic powers were reversed. People would flee her
sight. Her future in England was finished.

Never appear overly greedy for attention, then, for it signals insecurity,
and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are times when it
is not in your interest to be the center of attention. When in the presence of
a king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent thereof, bow and retreat to
the shadows; never compete.

TRANSGRESSION AND OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1883 a young Serbian scientist named Nikola Tesla was working for the
European division of the Continental Edison Company. He was a brilliant
inventor, and Charles Batchelor, a plant manager and a personal friend of
Thomas Edison, persuaded him he should seek his fortune in America, giv-
ing him a letter of introduction to Edison himself. So began a life of woe
and tribulation that lasted until Tesla’s death.

When Tesla met Edison in New York, the famous inventor hired him
on the spot. Tesla worked eighteen-hour days, finding ways to improve the
primitive Edison dynarnos. Finally he offered to redesign them completely.
To Edison this seemed a monumental task that could last years without
paying off, but he told Tesla, “’I&#x27;here’s fifty thousand dollars in it for you-—xf
you can do it.” Tesla labored day and night on the project and after only a
year he produced a greatly improved version of the dynamo, complete
with automatic controls. He went to Edison to break the good news and re-
ceive his $50,000. Edison was pleased with the improvement, for which he
and his company would take credit, but when it came to the issue of the
money he told the young Serb, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American
lmmori,” and offered a small raise instead.

Tesla’s obsession was to create an alternating-current system (AC) of
electricity. Edison believed in the direct—current system (DC), and not only
refused to support Tesla’s research but later did all he could to sabotage
him. Tesla turned to the great Pittsburgh magnate George Westinghouse,
who had started his own electricity company. Westinghouse completely
funded Tesla’: research and offered him a generous royalty agreement on
future profits. The AC system Tesla developed is still the standard today-—
but after patents were filed in his name, other scientists came forward to
take credit for the invention, claiming that they had laid the groundwork
for him. His name was lost in the shuffle, and the public came to associate
the invention with Westinghouse himself.

A year later, Westinghouse was caught

in a mkeover bid from
_}. Pierpont Morgan, who made him rescind the generous royalty contract
he had signed with Tesla. Westinghouse explained to the scientist that his
company would not survive if it had to pay him his full royalties; he per-
suaded Tesla to accept a buyout of his patents for $216,000-—a large sum,
no doubt, but far less than the $12 million they were worth at the time. The
financiers had divested Tesla of the riches, the patents, and essentially the
credit for the greatest invention of his career.

The name of Guglielmo Marconi is forever linked with the invention
of radio. But few know that in producing his invention-——he broadcast a sig-
nal across the English Channel in 1899--Marconi made use of a patent
Tesla had filed in 1897, and that his work depended on Tesla’.-i research.
Once again Tesla received no money and no credit. Tesla invented an in-
duction motor as well as the AC power system, and he is the real “father of
radio.” Yet none of these discoveries bear his name. As an old man, he
lived in poverty.

In 1917, during his later impoverished years, Tesla was told he was to
receive the Edison Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.
He turned the medal down. “You propose,” he said, “to honor me with a
medal which I could pin upon my coat and strut for a vain hour before the
members of your Institute. You would decorate my body and continue to
let starve, for failure to supply recognition, my mind and its creative prod
ucts, which have supplied the foundation upon which the major portion of
your Institute exists.”

Interpretation
Many harbor the illusion that science, dealing with facts as it does, is be
yond the petty rivalries that trouble the rest of the world. Nikola Tesla was
one of those. He believed science had nothing to do with politics, and
claimed not to care for fame and riches. As he grew older, though, this ru-
ined his scientific work. Not associated with any particular discovery, he
could attract no investors to his many ideas. While he pondered great in-
ventions for the future, others stole the patents he had already developed
and got the glory for themselves.

He wanted to do everything on his own, but merely exhausted and im-

poverished himselfin the process.

Edison was Tesla’s polar opposite. He wasn’t actually much of a scien~
tific thinker or inventor; he once said that he had no need to be a mathe-
matician because he could always hire one. That was Fdisoifs main
method. He was really a businessman and publicist, spotting the trends and
the opportunities that were out there, then hiring the best in the field to do
the work for him. If he had to he would steal from his competitors. Yet his
name is much better known than Tesla’s, and is associated with more in-
ventions.

The lesson is twofold: First, the credit for an invention or creation is as
important, if not more important, than the invention itself. You must secure
the credit for yourself and keep others from stealing it away, or from piggy—
backing on your hard work. To accomplish this you must always be vigilant
and ruthless, keeping your creation quiet until you can be sure there are no
vultures circling overhead. Second, learn to take advantage of other peo-
ple’s work to Further your own cause. Time is precious and life is short. If
you try to do it all on your own, you run yourself ragged, waste energy, and
burn yourself out. It is far better to conserve your forces, pounce on the
work others have done, and find a way to make it your own.

LAW 7

KEYS TO POWER
The world of power has flue dynamics of the jungle: There are those who
live by hunting and killing, and there are also vast numbers of creatures
(hyenas, vultures) who live oil&quot; the hunting of others. These latter, less
imaginative types are often incapable of doing the work that is essential for
the creation of power. They understand early on, though, that if they wait
long enough, they can always find another animal to do the work for them.
Do not be naive: At this very moment, while you are slaving away on some
project, there are vultures circling above trying to figure out a way to sur-
vive and even thrive off your creativity. It is useless to complain about this,
or to wear yourself ragged with bitterness, as Tesla did. Better to protect
yourself and join the game. Once you have established a power base, be-
come a vulture yourself, and save yourself a lot of time and energy.

Of the two poles of this game, one can be illustrated by the example of
the explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa. Balboa had an obsessionw-the dis-
covery of El Dorado, a legendary city of vast riches.

Early in the sixteenth century, after countless hardships and brushes
with death, he found evidence of a great and wealthy empire to the south
of Mexico, in present—day Peru. By conquering this empire, the Incan, and
seizing is gold, he would make himself the next Cortes. The problem was
that even as he made this discovery, word of it spread among hundreds of
other conquistadors. He did not understand that half the game was keeping
it quiet, and carefiilly watching those around him. A few years after he dis-
covered the location of the Incan empire, a soldier in his own army, Fran-
cisco Pizarro, helped to get him beheaded for treason. Pizarro went on to
take what Balboa had spent so many years trying to find.

The other pole is that of the artist Peter Paul Rubens, who, late in his
career, found himself deluged with requests for paintings. He created a sys-
tem: In his large studio he employed dozens of outstanding painters, one
specializing in robes, another in backgrounds, and so on. He created a vast
production line in which a large number of canvases would be worked on
at the same time. When an important client visited the studio, Rubens
would shoo his hired painters out for the day. While the client watched
from a balcony, Rubens would work at an incredible pace, with unbeliev-
able energy. The client would leave in awe of this prodigious man, who
could paint so many masterpieces in so short a time.

This is the essence of the Law: Loam to get others to do the work for
you while you take the credit, and you appear to be of godlike strength and
power. If you think it important to do all the work yourself, you will never
get far, and you will suffer the fate of the Balboas and Teslas of the world.
Find people with the skills and creativity you lack. Either hire them, while
putting your own name on top of theirs, or find a way to take their work
and make it your own. Their creativity thus becomes yours, and you seem
a genius to the world.

There is another application of this law that does not require the para-
sitic use of your contemporaries’ labor: Use the past, a vast storehouse of

knowledge and wisdom. Isaac Newton called this “standing on the shoul-
ders of giants.” He meant that in making his discoveries he had built on the
achievements of others. A great part of his aura of genius, he knew, was at-
tributable to his shrewd ability to make the most of the insights of ancient,
medieval, and Renaissance scientists. Shakespeare borrowed plots, charac-
terizations, and even dialogue from Plutarch, among other writers, for he
knew that nobody surpassed Plutarch in the writing of subtle psychology
and witty quotes. How many later writers have in their turn borrowed
from-~plagz&#x27;anlzed——Shakespeare?

We all know how few of today’s politicians write their own speeches.
Their own words would not win them a single vote; their eloquence and
wit, whatever there is of it, they owe to a speech writer. Other people
do the work, they take the credit. The upside of this is that it is a. kind
of power that is available to everyone. Learn to use the knowledge of the
past and you will look like a genius, even when you are really just a clever
borrower,

Writers who have delved into human nature, ancient masters of strat-
egy, historians of human stupidity and folly, kings and queens who have
leamed the hard way how to handle the burdens of power—-their knowl-
edge is gathering dust, waiting for you to come and stand on their shoul-
ders. Their wit can be your wit, their skill can be your skill, and they will
never come around to tell people how unoriginal you really are. You can
slog through life, making endless mistakes, wasting time and energy trying
to do things from your own experience. Or you can use the armies of the
past. As Bismarck once said, “Fools say that they learn by experience. I

There are times when taking the credit for work that others have done is
not the wise course: If your power is not firmly enough established, you
will seem to be pushing people out of the limelight. To be a. brilliant ex-
ploiter of talent your position must be unshakable, or you will be accused
of deception.

Be sure you know when letting other people share the credit serves
your purpose. It is especially important to not be greedy when you have a
master above you. President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to the People’s
Republic of China was originally his idea, but it might never have come off
but for the deft diploma/cy of Henry Kissinger. Nor would it have been as
successful without Kissinger’s skills. Stilh when the time came to take
credit, Kissinger adroitly let Nixon take the lion’s share. Knowing that the
truth would come out later, he was careful not to jeopardize his standing in
the short term by hogging the limelight. Kissinger played the game ex~
partly: He took credit for the work of those below him while graciously
giving credit for his own labors to those above. That is the way to play
the game.

OBSERVANCl:‘ OF THE LAW
At the Congress of Vienna in 1814, the major powers of Europe gathered to
carve up the remains of Napoleon’s fallen Empire. The city was full of gai-
ety and the balls were the most splendid in memory. Hovering over the
proceedings, however, was the shadow of Napoleon himself. Instead of
being executed or exiled far away, he had been sent to the island of Elba,
not far from the coast of Italy.

Even imprisoned on an island, a man as bold and creative as
Napoleon Bonaparte made everyone nervous. The Austrians plotted to kill
him on Elba, but decided it was too risky. Alexander I, Rnssia’s tempera»
mental czar, heightened the anxiety by throwing a {it during the congress
when a part of Poland was denied him: “Beware, I shall loose the mon-
ster!&quot; he threatened. Everyone knew he meant Napoleon. Of all the states
men gathered in Vienna, only Talleyrand, Napoleon’s former foreign
minister, seemed calm and unconcerned. It was as if he knew something
the others did not.

Meanwhile, on the island of Elba, Napoleon&#x27;s life was a mockery of his
previous glory. As Elba’s “king,” he had been allowed to form a court-—
there was a cook, a wardrobe mistress, an official pianist, and a. handful of
courtiers. All this was designed to humiliate Napoleon, and it seemed to
work.

That winter, however, there occurred a. series of events so strange and
dramatic they might have been scripted in a play. Elba was surrounded by
British ships, their cannons covering all possible exit points. Yet somehow,
in broad daylight on 26 February 1815, a ship with nine hundred men on
board picked up Napoleon and put to sea The English gave chase but the
impossible escape astonished the public
ship got away. This almost
throughout Europe, and terrified the statesmen at the Congress of Vienna.
Although it would have been safer to leave Europe, Napoleon not only
chose to return to France, he raised the odds by marching on Paris with a
tiny army, in hopes of recapturing the throne. His strategy worked——people
of all classes threw themselves at his feet. An army under Marshal Ney sped
from Paris to arrest him, but when the soldiers saw their beloved former
leader, they changed sides. Napoleon was declared emperor again. Volun-
teers swelled the ranks of his new army. Delirium swept the country. In Paris,
crowds went wild. The king who had replaced Napoleon fled the country.

For the next hundred days, Napoleon ruled France. Soon, however, the
giddiness subsided. France was bankrupt, its resources nearly exhausted,
and there was little Napoleon could do about this. At the Battle of Waterloo,
injune of that year, he was finally defeated for good. This time his enemies
had learned their lesson: They exiled him to the barren island of Saint I-Ie~
lena, off the west coast of Africa. There he had no more hope of escape.

Interpretation
Only years later did the facts of Napoleon&#x27;s dramatic escape from Elba
come to light. Before he decided to attempt this bold move, visitors to his
court had told him that he was more popular in France than ever, and that

LAW 8

63

the country would embrace him again. One of these visitors was Austria’s
General Keller, who convinced Napoleon that if he escaped, the European
powers, England included, would welcome him back into power. Napoleon
was tipped off that the English would let him go, and indeed his escape oc-
curred in the middle of the afternoon, in full view of English spyglasses.

What Napoleon did not know was that there was a man behind it all,
pulling the strings, and that this man was his former minister, Talleyrand.
And Talleyrand was doing all this not to bring back the glory days but to
crush Napoleon once and for all. Considering the emperor’s ambition un-
settling to Europe’s stability, he had turned against him long ago. When
Napoleon was exiled to Elba, Talleyrand had protested. Napoleon should
be sent farther away, he argued, or Europe would never have peace. But
no one Listened.

Instead of pushing his opinion, Talleyrand bided his time. Working
quietly, he eventually won over Castlereagh and Metternich, the foreign
ministers of England and Austria.

Together these men baited Napoleon into escaping. Even Koller’s visit,
to whisper the promise of glory in the exile’s ear, was part of the plan. Like
a master cardplayer, Talleyrand figured everything out in advance. He
knew Napoleon would fall into the trap he had set He also foresaw that
Napoleon would lead the country into a war, which, given France’s wea.k~
ened condition, could only last a few months. One diplomat in Vienna,
who understood that Talleyrand was behind it all, said, “He has set the
house ablaze in order to save it from the plague.”

KEYS TO POWER
How many times has this scenario played itself out in history: An aggres~
sive leader initiates a series of bold moves that begin by bringing him
much power. Slowly, however, his power reaches a peak, and soon every-
thing turns against him. His numerous enemies band together; trying to
maintain his power, he exhausts himself going in this direction and that,
and inevitably he collapses. The reason for this pattern is that the aggres-
sive person is rarely in full control. He cannot see more than a couple of
moves ahead, cannot see the consequences of this bold move or that one.
Because he is constantly being forced to react to the moves of his ever-
growing host of enemies, and to the unforeseen consequences of his own
rash actions, his aggressive energy is turned against him.

In the realm of power, you must ask yourself, what is the point of chas-
ing here and there, trying to solve problems and defeat my enemies, if I
never feel in control? Why am I always having to react to events instead of
directing them? The answer is simple: Your idea of power is wrong. You

M

LAW 8

have mistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most often the
most effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be frustrated
by the trips you lay for them, playing for long-term power rather than
quick victory.

Remember: The essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative,
to get others to react to your moves, to keep your opponent and those
around you on the defensive. When you make other people come to you,
you suddenly become the one controlling the situation. And the one who
has control has power. Two things must happen to place you in this posi-
tion: You yourself must learn to master your emotions, and never to be in-
fluenced by anger; meanwhile, however, you must play on people’s natural
tendency to react angrily when pushed and baited. In the long run, the
ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any
tool of aggression.

Study how Talleyrand, the master of the art, performed this delicate
trick. First, he overcame the urge to try to convince his fellow statesmen
that they needed to banish Napoleon far away. It is only natural to want to
persuade people by pleading your case, imposing your will with words. But
this often turns against you. Few of Talleyrand’s contemporaries believed
Napoleon was still a threat, so that if he had spent a lot of energy trying to
convince them, he would only have made himself look foolish. Instead, he
held his tongue and his emotions in check. Most important of all, he laid
Napoleon a sweet and irresistible trap. He knew the man’s weakness, his
impetuosity, his need for glory and the love of the masses, and he played
all this to perfection. When Napoleon went for the bait, there was no dan-
ger that he might succeed and turn the tables on Talleyrand, who better
than anyone knew France’s depleted state. And even had Napoleon been
able to overcome these difficulties, the likelihood of his success would have
been greater were he able to choose his time and place of action. By setting
the proper trap, Talleyrand took the time and place into his own hands.

All of us have only so much energy, and there is a moment when our
energies are at their peak. ‘When you make the other person come to you,
he wears himself out, wasting his energy on the trip. In the year 1905, Rus-
sia ancl japan were at war. The Japanese had only recently begun to mod
emize their warships, so that the Russians had a stronger navy, but by
spreading false information the Japanese marshal Togo Heihachiro baited
the Russians into leaving their docks in the Baltic Sea, making them believe
they could wipe out the Japanese fleet in one swift attack. The Russian fleet
could not reachjapan by the quickest route——through the Strait of Gibral—
tar and then the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean&quot;-because these were
controlled by the British, and japan was an ally of Great Britain. They had
to go around the Cape of Good Hope, at the southern tip of Africa, adding
over more than six thousand miles to the voyage. Once the fleet passed the
Cape, the Japanese spread another false story: They were sailing to launch
a counterattack. So the Russians made the entire journey to japan on conr
bat alert. By the time they arrived, their seamen were tense, exhausted, and
overworked, while the Japanese had been waiting at their ease. Despite the

LAW 8

65

odds and their lack of experience in modem naval warfare, the Japanese
crushed the Russians.

One added benefit of making the opponent come to you, as the _]a.pa—
nese discovered with the Russians, is that it forces him to operate in your
territory. Being on hostile ground will make him nervous and often he will
rush his actions and make mistakes. For negotiations or meetings, it is al-
ways wise to lure others into your territory, or the territory of your choice.
You have your bearings, while they see nothing familiar and are subtly
placed on the defensive.

Manipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is
being manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control him. But
when you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion that he
is controlling the situation. He does not feel the strings that pull hirmjust as
Napoleon imagined that he himself was the master of his daring escape and
return to power.

Everything depends on the sweetness of your bait. If your trap is at»
tractive enough, the turbulence of your enemies’ emotions and desires will
blind them to reality. The greedier they become, the more they can he led
around.

The great nineteenth-century robber baron Daniel Drew was a master
at playing the stock market. When he wanted a particular stock to be
bought or sold, driving prices up or down, he rarely resorted to the direct
approach. One of his tricks was to hurry through an exclusive club near
Wall Street, obviously on his way to the stock exchange, and to pull out his
customary red bandanna to wipe his perspiring brow. A slip of paper
would fall from this bandanna that he would pretend not to notice. The
club’s members were always trying to foresee Drew’s moves, and they
would pounce on the paper, which invariably seemed to contain an inside
up on a stock. Word would spread, and members would buy or sell the
stock in droves, playing perfectly into Drew’s hands.

If you can get other people to dig their own graves, why sweat your-
self? Pickpockets work this to perfection. The key to picking a pocket is
knowing which pocket contains the wallet. Experienced pickpockets often
ply their trade in train stations and other places where there is a. clearly
marked sign reading BEWARE OF PICKPOCKE’l‘S. Passersby seeing the sign in-
variably feel for their wallet to make sure it is still there. For the watching
pickpockets, this is like shooting fish in a barrel. Pickpockets have even
been known to place their own BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS signs to ensure
their success.

V/Vhen you are making people come to you, it is sometimes better to let
them know you are forcing their hand. You give up deception for overt ma-
nipulation. The psychological ramifications are profound: The person who
makes others come to him appears powerful, and demands respect.

Filippo Brunelleschi, the great Renaissance artist and architect, was a
great practitioner of the art of making others come to him as a sign of his
power. On one occasion he had been engaged to repair the dome of the
Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Florence. The commission was impor-

66

LAW 8

lam and prestigious. But when the city officials hired a second man,
Lorenzo Ghibem‘, to work with B1-unelleschi, the great artist brooded in se~
cret. He knew that Ghiberti had gotten the job through his connections,
and that he would do none of the work and get half the credit. At a critical
moment of the construction, then, Brunelleschi suddenly developed a mys-
terious illness. He had to stop work, but pointed out to city officials that
they had hired Ghiberti, who should have been able to continue the work
on his own. Soon it became clear that Ghiberti was useless and the ofiicials
came begging to Brunelleschi. He ignored them, insisting that Ghiberti
should finish the project, until finally they realized the problem: They fired
Ghiberti.

By some miracle, Bnmelleschi recovered within days. He did not have
to throw a tantrum or make a fool of himself; he simply practiced the art of
“making others come to you.”

If on one occasion you make it a point of dignity that others must
come to you and you succeed, they will continue to do so even after you
stop trying.

REVERSAL
Although it is generally the wiser policy to make others exhaust themselves
chasing you, there are opposite cases where strildng suddenly and aggres-
sively at the enemy so demoralizes him that his energies sink. Instead of
making others come to you, you go to them, force the issue, take the lead.
Fast attack can be an awesome weapon, for it forces the other person to
react without the time to think or plan. With no time to think, people make
errors of judgment, and are thrown on the defensive. This tactic is the ob-
verse of waiting and baiting, but it serves the same function: You make
your enemy respond on your terms.

Men like Cesare Borgia and Napoleon used the element of speed to in-
timidate ancl control. A rapid and unforeseen move is terrifying and de-
moralizing. You must choose your tactics depending on the situation. If
you have time on your side, and know that you and your enemies are at
least at equal strength, then deplete their strength by making them come to
you. If time is against you—-your enemies are weaker, and waiting will only
give them the chance to recover—-give them no such chance. Strike quickly
and they have nowhere to go. As the boxer Joe Louis put it, “He can run,
but he can’t hide.”

’[&#x27;RAl\&#x27;S(.&#x27;)RF.SSlON OF THE LAW
In 131 1313., the Roman consul Publius Crassus Dives Mucianus, laying
siege to the Greek town of Pergamus, found himself in need of a battering
ram to force through the town’s walls. He had seen a couple of hefty ship’s
masts in a shipyard in Athens a few days before, and he ordered that the
larger of these be sent to him immediately. The military engineer in Athens
who received the order felt certain that the consul really wanted the
smaller of the masts. He argued endlessly with the soldiers who delivered
the request: The smaller mast, he told them, was much better suited to the
task. And indeed it would be easier to transport.

The soldiers warned the engineer that their master was not a man to
argue with, but he insisted that the smaller mast would be the only one that
would work with a machine that he was constructing to go with it. He drew
diagram after diagram, and went so far as to say that he was the expert and
they had no clue what they were talking about. The soldiers knew their
leader and at last convinced the engineer that it would be better to swallow
his expertise and obey.

After they left, though, the engineer thought about it some more. What
was the point, he asked himself, in obeying an order that would lead to fail-
ure? And so he sent the smaller mast, confident that the consul would see
how much more effective it was and reward him justly.

When the smaller mast arrived, Mucianus asked his soldiers for an ex-
planation. They described to him how the engineer had argued endlessly
for the smaller mast, but had finally promised to send the larger one. Mu-
cianus went into a rage. He could not concentrate on the siege, or consider
the importance of breaching the walls before the town received reinforce»
merits. All he could think about was the impudent engineer, whom he or-
dered to be brought to him immediately.

Arriving a few days later, the engineer gladly explained to the consul,
one more time, the reasons for the smaller mast He went on and on, using
the same arguments he had made with the soldiers. He said it was wise to
listen to experts in these matters, and if the attack was only tried with the
battering ram he had sent, the consul would not regret it Mucianus let him
finish, then had him stripped naked before the soldiers and flogged and
scourged with rods until he died.

Interpretation
The engineer, whose name has not been recorded by history, had spent his
life designing masts and pillars, and was respected as the finest engineer in
a city that had excelled in the science. He knew that he was right. A smaller
ram would allow more speed and carry more force. Larger is not necessar-
ily better. Of course the consul would see his logic, and would eventually
understand that science is neutral and reason superior. How could the con-
sul possibly persist in his ignorance if the engineer showed him detailed di-
agrams and explained the theories behind his advice?

The military engineer was the quintessence of the Arguer, at type

ligence of one more powerful than he. He also has no awareness of the per-
son he is dealing with. Since each man believes that he is right, and words
will rarely convince him otherwise, the arguer’s reasoning falls on deaf
ears. When cornered, he only argues more, digging his own grave. Once
he has made the other person feel insecure and inferior in his beliefs, the

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1502,
in Florence, Italy, an enormous block of marble stood in the
works department of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore. It had once been
a magnificent piece of raw stone, but an unskillful sculptor had mistakenly
bored a hole through it where there should have been a figure’s legs, gen-
erally mutilating it. Piero Soderini, Florence’s mayor, had contemplated
trying to save the block by commissioning Leonardo da Vinci to work on
it, or some other master, but had given up, since everyone agreed that the
stone had been ruined. So, despite the money that had been wasted on it, it
gathered dust in the dark halls of the church.

This was where things stood until some Florentine friends of the great
Michelangelo decided to write to the artist, then living in Rome. He alone,
they said, could do something with the marble, which was still magnificent
raw material. Michelangelo traveled to Florence, examined the stone, and
came to the conclusion that he could in fact carve a fine figure from it, by
adapting the pose to the way the rock had been mutilated. Soderini argued
that this was a waste of time——nobody could salvage such a disasterwbut
he finally agreed to let the artist work on it. Michelangelo decided he
would depict a. young David, sling in hand.

Weeks later, as Michelangelo was putting the final touches on the
statue, Soderini entered the studio. Fancying himself it bit of a connoisseur,
he .-studied the huge work, and told Michelangelo that while he thought it
was magnificent, the nose, he judged, was too big. Michelangelo realized
that Soderini was standing in 2 place right under the giant figure and did
not have the proper perspective. Without a word, he gestured for Soderini
to follow him up the scaffolding. Reaching the nose, he picked up his
as well as a bit of marble dust that lay on the planks. With Sodetini
just a few feet below him on the scaffolding. Michelangelo started to tap
lightly with the chisel, letting the bits of dust he had gathered in his hand to
fall little by little. He actually did nothing to change the nose, but gave
every appearance of working on it. After a few minutes of this charade he
stood aside: “Look at it now.” “I like it better,” replied Soderini, “you’ve
made it come alive.”

Michelangelo knew that by changing the shape of the nose he might ruin
the entire sculpture. Yet Soderini was a patron who prided himself on his
aesthetic judgment. To offend such a man by arguing would not only gain
future commissions in jeopardy.

making him realize that this was the cause of his misperception.

Fortunately for posterity, Michelangelo found a way to keep the per
faction of the statue intact while at the same time making Soderini believe
he had improved it. Such is the double power of winning through actions
rather than argument: No one is offended, and your point is proven.

KEYS T0 POWER
In the realm of power you must learn to judge your moves by their long»
term effects on other people. The problem in trying to prove a point or
gain a. victory through argument is that in the end you can never be certain
how it affects the people you’re arguing with: They may appear to agree
with you politely, but inside they may resent you. Or perhaps something
you said inadvertently even offended thern—-words have that insidious
ability to be interpreted according to the other person’s mood and insecuri-
ties. Even the best argument has no solid foundation, for we have all come
to distrust the slippery nature of words. And days after agreeing with some
one, we ofien revert to our old opinion out of sheer habit.

Understand this: Words are a dime a dozen. Everyone knows that in
the heat of an argument, we will all say anything to support our cause. We
will quote the Bible, refer to unverifiable statistics. Who can be persuaded
by bags of air like that? Action and demonstration are much more power-
ful and meaningful. They are there, before our eyes, for us to see-——“Yes,
now the statue’s nose does look just right.” There are no offensive words,
no possibility of misinterpretation. No one can argue with a demonstrated
proof. As Baltasar Graciim remarks, “The midi is generally seen, rarely
heard.”

Sir Christopher Wren was England’s version of the Renaissance man.
He had mastered the sciences of mathematics, astronomy, physics, and
physiology. Yet during his extremely long career as England’s most Cele‘
brated architect he was often told by his patrons to make impractical
changes in his designs. Never once did he argue or offend. He had other
ways of proving his point.

In 1688 Wren designed a magnificent town hall for the city of West-
minster. The mayor, however. was not satisfied; in fact he was nervous. He
told Wren he was afraid the second {floor was not secure, and that it could
all come crashing down on his office on the first floor. He demanded that
Wren add two stone columns for extra support. Wren, the consummate en-
gineer, knew that these columns would serve no purpose, and that the

mayor’s fears were baseless. But build them he did, and the mayor was
grateful. It was only years later that workmen on a high scaffold saw that
the columns stopped just short of the ceiling.

They were dummies. But both men got what they wanted: The mayor
could relax, and Wren knew posterity would understand that his original
dedgn worked and the columns were unnecessary.

The power of demonstrating your idea is that your opponents do not
get defensive, and are therefore more open to persuasion. Making them lit-
erally and physically feel your meaning is infinitely more powerful than are
gument.

A heclder once interrupted Nikita. Khrushchev in the middle of a
speech in which he was denouncing the crimes of Stalin. “You were a col-
league of Stalirfs,” the heekler yelled, “why didn’t you stop him then?”
Khrushschev apparently could not see the heckler and barked out, “VVho
said that?” No hand went up. No one moved a muscle. After a few seconds
of tense silence, Khrushchev finally said in a quiet voice, “Now you know
why I didn’t stop him.” Instead of just arguing that anyone facing Stalin
was afraid, knowing that the slightest sign of rebellion would mean certain
death, he had made them feel what it was like to face Stalin———had made
them feel the paranoia, the fear of speaking up, the terror of confronting
the leader, in this case Khrushchev. The demonstration was visceral and no
more argument was necessary.

The most powerful persuasion goes beyond action into symbol. The
power of a symbol——a flag, a mythic story, a monument to some emotional
event--is that everyone understands you without anything being said. In
1975, when Henry Kissinger was engaged in some frusti-ating negotiations
with the Israelis over the return of part of the Sinai desert that they had
seized in the 1967 war, he suddenly broke off a tense meeting and decided
to do some sightseeing. He paid a visit to the ruins of the ancient fortress
of Masada, known to all Israelis as the place where seven hundred Jewish
warriors committed mass suicide in A.I). 73 rather than give in to the
Roman troops besieging them. The Israelis instantly understood the mes-
sage of Kissingefs visit: He was indirectly accusing them of courting mass
suicide. Although the visit did not by itself change their minds, it made
them think far more seriously than any direct warning would have. Syrn~
bols like this one carry great emotional significance.

When aiming for power, or trying to conserve it, always look for the
indirect route. And also choose your battles carefully. If it does not matter
in the long run whether the other person agrees with you-«or if time and
their own experience will make them understand what you mean——then it
is best not even to bother with a demonstration. Save your energy and
walk away.

REVERSAL
Verbal argument has one vital use in the realm of power: To distract and
cover your tracks when you are practicing deception or are caught in a lie.
In such cases it is to your advantage to argue with all the conviction you
can muster. Draw the other person into an argument to distract them fmm
your deceptive move. When caught in a lie, the more emotional and cer-
tain you appear, the less likely it seems that you are lying.

This technique has saved the hide of many a con artist. Once Count
Victor Lustig, swindle: par excellence, had sold dozens of suckers around
the country a phony box with which he claimed to be able to copy money.
Discovering their mistake, the suckers generally chose not to go the police,
rather than risk the embarrassment of publicity. But one Sherifi Richards,

74

LAW 9

of Rernsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept being
conned out of $10,000, and one morning he tracked Lustig down to a hotel
in Chicago.

Lustig heard a knock on the door. When he opened it he was looking
down the barrel of a gun. “What seems to be the problem?” he calmly
asked. “You son of a bitch,” yelled the sheriff, “I’m going to kill you. You
conned me with that damn box of yours!” Lustig feigned confusion. “You
mean it’s not working?” he asked. “You know it’s not working,” replied the
sheriff. “But that’s impossible,” said Lustig. “There’s no way it couldn’t be
working. Did you operate it properly?” “I did exactly what you told me to
do,” said the sheriff. “No, you must have done something wrong,” said
Lustig. The argument went in circles. The barrel of the gun was gently low-
cred.

Lustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured out a
whole bunch of technical gobbledygook about the borfis operation, com-
pletely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less sure of himself and ar-
gued less forcefully. “Look,” said Lusfig, “I’ll give you your money back
right now. I’ll also give you written instruclions on how to work the ma-
chine and I’ll come out to Oklahoma to make sure it’s working properly.
There’s no way you can lose on that.” The sheriff reluctantly agreed. To
satisfy him totally, Lustig took out a hundred one-hundred—dollar bills and
gave them to him, telling him to relax and have a fun weekend in Chicago.
Calmer and a little confused, the sheriff finally left Over the next few days
Lustig checked the paper every morning. He finally found what he was
looking for: A short arficle reporting Sheriff Richa.rcls’s arrest, trial, and
conviction for passing counterfeit notes. Lustig had won the argument; the
sheriff never bothered him again.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Born in Limerick, Ireland, in 1813, Marie Gilbert came to Paris in the
18405 to make her fortune as a dancer and performer. Taking the name
Lola Montez (her mother was of distant Spanish descent), she claimed to
be a flamenco dancer from Spain. By 1845 her career was languishing, and
to survive she became a courtesa.n—-quicldy one of the more successful in
Paris.

Only one man could salvage Lola’s dancing career: Alexandre Du-
jaxier, owner of the newspaper with the largest circulation in France, and
also the newspaper’s drama critic. She decided to woo and conquer him.
Investigating his habits, she discovered that he went riding every morning.
An excellent horsewoman herself, she rode out one morning and “acciden~
tally” ran into him. Soon they were riding together every day. A few weeks
later Lola moved into his apartment.

For a while the two were happy together. With Duja.rier’s help, Lola
began to revive her dancing career. Despite the risk to his social standing,
Dujarier told friends he would marry her in the spring. (Lola had never
told him that she had eloped at age nineteen with an Englishman, and was
still legally married.) Although Dujarier was deeply in love, his life started
to slide downhill.

His fortunes in business changed and influential friends began to avoid
him. One night Dujarier was invited to a party, attended by some of the
wealthiest young men in Paris. Lola wanted to go too but he would not
allow it. They had their first quarrel, and Dujarier attended the party by
himself. There, hopelessly drunk, be insulted an influential drama critic,
jean-Baptiste Rosemond de Beauvallon, perhaps because of something the
critic had said about Lola. The following morning Beauvallon challenged
him to a duel. Beauvallon was one of the best pistol shots in France. Du-
jarier tried to apologize, but the duel took place, and he was shot and
killed. Thus ended the life of one of the most promising young men of
Paris society. Devastated, Lola left Paris.

In 1846 Lola. Montez found herself in Munich, where she decided to
woo and conquer King Ludwig of Bavaria. The best way to Ludwig, she
discovered, was through his aide-de-camp, Count Otto Von Rechberg, a
man with a fondness for pretty girls. One day when the count was break-
fastirig at an outdoor cafe, Lola rode by on her horse, was “accidentally”
thrown from the saddle, and landed at Rechberg’s feet. The count rushed
to help her and was enchanted. He promised to introduce her to Ludwig.

Rechberg arranged an audience with the king for Lola, but when she
arrived in the anteroom, she could hear the king saying he was too busy to
meet a favorseeking stranger. Lola pushed aside the sentries and entered
his room anyway. In the process, the front of her dress somehow got torn
(perhaps by her, perhaps by one of the sentries), and to the astonishment of
all, most especially the king, her bare breasts were brazenly exposed. Lola
was granted her audience with Ludwig. Fifty—five hours later she made her
debut on the Bavarian stage; the reviews were terrible, but that did not stop
Ludwig from arranging more performances.

Ludwig was,

in his own words, “bewitched” by Lola. He started
to appear in public with her on his arm, and then he bought and furnished
an apartment for her on one of Munich’s most fashionable boulevards. Al»
though he had been known as a miser, and was not given to flights of
and to write poetry for her. Now
fancy, he started to shower Lola with
his favored mistress, she catapulted to fame and fortune overnight.

Lola began to lose her sense of proportion. One day when she was out
riding, an elderly man rode ahead of her, a bit too slowly for her liking.
Unable to pass him, she began to slash him with her riding crop. On an-
other occasion she took her dog, unleashed, out for a stroll. The dog at»
tacked a passerby, but instead of helping the men get the dog away, she
whipped him with the leash. Incidents like this infuriated the stolid citizens
of Bavaria, but Ludwig stood by Lola and even had her naturalized as a
Bavarian citizen. The kings entourage tried to wake him to the dangers of
the affair, but those who criticized Lola were summarily fired.

While Bavarians who had loved their king now outwardly disre—
spected him, Lola was made a countess, had a new palace built for herself,
and began to dabble in politics, advising Ludwig on policy. She was the
most powerful force in the kingdom. Her influence in the king’s cabinet
continued to grow, and she treated the other ministers with disdain. As a
result, riots broke out throughout the realm. A once peaceful land was vir~
rually in the grip of civil war, and students everywhere were chanting,
“Raus mit Lola!”

By February of 1848, Ludwig was finally unable to withstand the pres-
sure. With great sadness he ordered Lola. to leave Bavaria immediately.
She left, but not until she was paid off. For the next five weeks the Bevan‘-
ans’ wrath was turned against their formerly beloved king. In March of that
year he was forced to abdicate.

Lola Montez moved to England. More than anything she needed re-
spectability, and despite being married (she still had not arranged a divorce
from the Englishman she had wed years before), she set her sights on
George Trafford Heald, a promising young army olficer who was the son of
an influential hamster. Although he was ten years younger than Lola, and
could have chosen a wife among the prettiest and wealthiest young girls of
English society, Heald fell under her spell. They were married in 1849.
Soon arrested on the charge of bigamy, she skipped bail, and she and
Heald made their way to Spain. They quarreled horribly and on one occa-
sion Lola slashed him with a. knife. Finally, she drove him away. Returning
to England, he found he had lost his position in the army. Ostracized from
English society, he moved to Portugal, where he lived in poverty. After a
few months his short life ended in a boating accident.

A few years later the man who published Lola Montez’s autobiogra-

phy went bankrupt

In 1853 Lola moved to California, where she met and married a man
named Pat Hull. Their relationship was as stormy as all the others, and she
left Hull for another man. He took to drink and fell into a deep depression
that lasted until he died, four years later, still a relatively young man.

At the age of forty—one, Lola gave away her clothes and finery and
turned to God. She toured America, lecturing on religious topics, dressed
in white and wearing a halolike white headgear. She died two years later, in
1861.

Interpretation
Lola Montez attracted men with her wiles, but her power over them went
beyond the sexual. It was through the force of her character that she kept
her lovers enthralled. Men were sucked into the maelstrom she churned up
around her. They felt confused, upset, but the strength of the emotions she
stirred also made them feel more alive.

As is often the case with infection, the problems would only arise over
time. Lola’s inherent instability would begin to get under her lovers’ skin.
They would find themselves drawn into her problems, but their emotional
attachment to her would make them want to help her. This was the crucial
point of the clisease--for Lola Montez could not be helped. Her problems
were too deep. Once the lover identified with them, he was lost. He would
find himself embroiled in quarrels. The infection would spread to his fam-
ily and friends, or, in the case of Ludwig, to an entire nation. The only so
lution would be to cut her off, or suller an eventual collapse.

The infecting-character type is not restricted to women; it has nothing
to do with gender. It stems from an inward instability that radiates outward,
drawing disaster upon itself. There is almost a desire to destroy and unset
tle. You could spend a lifetime studying the pathology of infecting charac-
ters, but don’t waste your time—just learn the lesson. When you suspect
you are in the presence of an infector, don’t argue, don’t try to help, don’t
pass the person on to your friends, or you will become enmeshed. Flee the
ix1fector’s presence or suffer the consequences.

stances beyond their control deserve all the help and sympathy we can
give them. But there are others who are not born to misfortune or unhappi~
ness, but who draw it upon themselves by their destructive actions and un-
settling effect on others. It would be a great thing if we could raise them up,
change their patterns, but more often than not it is their patterns that end
up getting inside and changing us. The reason is siinple-humans are ex-
tremely susceptible to the moods, emotions, and even the ways of thinking
of those with whom they spend their time.

The incurably unhappy and unstable have a particularly strong infect»

mg power because their characters and emotions are so intense. They often
present themselves as victims, making it difficult, at first, to see their mis-
eries as self-inflicted. Before you realize the real nature of their problems
you have been infected by them.

Understand this: In the game of power, the people you associate with
are critical. The risk of associating with infeclors is that you will waste valu
able time and energy trying to free yourself. Through a kind of guilt by as-
sociation, you will also suffer in the eyes of others. Never underestimate the
dangers of infection.

There are many kinds of infector to be aware of, but one of the most
insidious is the sufferer from chronic dissatisfaction. Cassius, the Roman
conspirator against Julius Caesar, had the discontent that comes from deep
envy. He simply could not endure the presence of anyone of greater talent.
Probably because Caesar sensed the man’s interminable soumess, he
passed him up for the position of first praetorship, and gave the position to
Brutus instead. Cassius brooded and broorled, his hatred for Caesar be
coming pathological. Brutus himself, a. devoted republican, disliked Cae-
sar’s dictatorship; had he had the patience to wait, he would have become
the first man in Rome after Ca.esar‘s death, and could have undone the evil
that the leader had wrought. But Cassius infected him with his own rancor,
bending his ear daily with tales of Caesafs evil. He finally won Brutus over
to the conspiracy. It was the beginning of a great tragedy. How many mis-
fortunes could have been avoided had Brutus learned to fear the power of
infection.

There is only one solution to infection: quarantine. But by the time
you recognize the problem it is often too late. A Lola Montez oveiwhelms
you with her forceful personality. Cassius intrigues you with his confiding
nature and the depth of his feelings. How can you protect yourself against
such insidious viruses? The answer lies in judging people on the effects
they have on the world and not on the reasons they give for their prob-

tor; learn to see the discontent in their eye. Most important of all, do not
take pity. Do not enmesh yourself in trying to help. The infector will re
main unchanged, but you will be unhinged.

The other side of infection is equally valid, and perhaps more readily
understood: There are people who attract happiness to themselves by their
good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelligence. They are a source of plea:
sure, and you must associate with them to share in the prospeiity they draw
upon themselves.

50

LAW 10

This applies to more than good cheer and success: All positive quali~
ties can infect us. Talley:-and had many strange and intimidating traits, but
most agreed that he surpassed all Frenchmen in gmciousness, aristocratic
charm, and wit. Indeed he came from one of the oldest noble families in
the country, and despite his belief in democracy and the French Republic,
he retained his courtly manners. His contemporary Napoleon was in many
ways the opposite~—~a peasant from Corsica, tacitum and ungracious, even
violent.

There was no one Napoleon admired more than Talleyrand. He en-
vied his minister’s way with people, his wit and his ability to charm
women, and as best he could, he kept Talleyrand around him, hoping to
soak up the culture he lacked. There is no doubt that Napoleon changed as
his rule continued. Many of the rough edges were smoothed by his con-
stant association with Talleyrand.

.

Use the positive side of this emotional osmosis to advantage. If, for ex-
ample, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a certain limit;
only generous souls attain greatness. Associate with the generous, then,
and they will infect you, opening up everything that is tight and restricted
in you. If you are gloomy, gravitate to the cheerful. If you are prone to iso
lation, force yourselfto befriend the gregarious. Never associate with those
who share your defects——~they will reinforce everything that holds you
back. Only create associations with positive aflinities. Make this a rule of
life and you will benefit more than from all the therapy in the world.

Authority: Recognize the fortu~
nate so that you may choose
their company, and the 1mfortu—
nate so that you may avoid
them. Misfortune is usually the
crime of folly, and among those
who suffer from it there is no
malady more contagious: Never
open your door to the least of
misfortunes, for, if you do, many
others will follow in its train. .
Do not die of another’s misery.
{Baltasar Grecian, 1601-1658)

.

.

REVERSAL
This law admits of no reversal. Its application is universal. There is nothing
to be gained by associating with those who infect you with their misery;
there is only power and good fortune to be obtained by associating with
the fortunate. Ignore this law at your peril.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Sometime in the Middle Ages, a mercenary soldier (a condottiere), whose
name has not been recorded, saved the town of Siena from a foreign ag~
gressor. How could the good citizens of Siena reward him? No amount of
money or honor could possibly compare in value to the preservation of a
city’s liberty. The citizens thought of making the mercenary the lord of the
city, but even that, they decided, wasn’t recompense enough. At last one of
them stood before the assembly called to debate this matter and said, “Let
us kill him and then worship him as our patron saint.” And so they did.

The Count of Carmagnola was one of the bravest and most successful
of all the condottieri. In 1442, late in his life, he was in the employ of the city
of Venice, which was in the midst of a long war with Florence. The count
was suddenly recalled to Venice. A favorite of the people, he was received
there with all kinds of honor and splendor. That evening he was to dine
with the doge himself, in the doge’s palace. On the way into the palace,
however, he noticed that the guard was leading him in a different direction
from usual. Crossing the famous Bridge of Sighs, he suddenly realized
where they were taking him—to the dungeon. He was convicted on a
trurnped~up charge and the next day in the Piazza San Marco, before a
horrified crowd who could not understand how his fate had changed s
drastically, he was beheaded.

&#x27;

interpretation
Many of the great tomlottieri of Renaissance Italy suffered the same fate as
the patron saint of Siena and the Count of Carrnagnolaz They won battle
after battle for their employers only to find themselves banished, impris-
oned, or executed. The problem was not ingratitude; it was that there were
so many other candottieri as able and valiant as they were. They were re-
placeable. Nothing was lost by killing them. Meanwhile, the older among
them had grown powerful themselves, and wanted more and more money
for their services. How much better, then, to do away with them and hire a
younger, cheaper mercenary. That was the fate of the Count of Carma-
gnola, who had started to act impudently and independently. He had taken
his power for granted without making sure that he was truly indispensable.
Such is the fate (to a less violent degree, one hopes) of those who do
not make others dependent on them. Sooner or later someone comes along
who can do the job as well as they can-—someone younger, fresher, less ex-
pensive, less threatening.

Be the only one who can do what you do, and make the fate of those who
hire you so entwined with yours that they cannot possibly get rid of you.
Otherwise you will someday be forced to cross your own Bridge of Sighs.

around him, he decided that the side to ally himself with was not the par
liament’s liberals or conservatives, not any particular minister, and cer-
tainly not the people. It was with the king, Frederick William IV. This was
an odd choice to say the least, for Frederick was at a low point of his power.
A weak, indecisive man, he consistently gave in to the liberals in pa1:lia~
merit; in fact he was spineless, and stood for much that Bismarck disliked,
personally and politically. Yet Bismarck courted Frederick night and day.
When other deputies attacked the king for his many inept moves, only Bis-
marck stood by him.

Finally, it all paid off: In 1851 Bismarck was made a minister in the
king’s cabinet. Now he went to work. Time and again he forced the king’s
hand, getting him to build up the military, to stand up to the liberals, to do
exactly as Bismarck wished. He worked on Frederick’s insecurity about his
manliness, challenging him to be firm and to rule with pride. And he
slowly restored the king’s powers until the monarchy was once again the
most powerful force in Prussia.
When Frederick died,

in 1861, his brother William assumed the
throne. William disliked Bismarck intensely and had no intention of keep
ing him around. But he also inherited the same situation his brother had:
enemies galore, who wanted to nibble his power away. He actually consid-
ered abdicating, feeling he lacked the strength to deal with this dangerous
and precarious position. But Bismarck insinuated himself once again. He
stood by the new king, gave him strength, and urged him into firm and de
cisive action. The king grew dependent on Bismarck’s strong-arm tactics to
keep his enemies at bay, and despite his antipathy toward the man, he soon
made him his prime minister. The two quarreled often over policy———
Bismarck was much more conservative——but the king understood his own
dependency. Whenever the prime minister threatened to resign, the king
gave in to him, time after time. It was in fact Bismarck who set state policy.
Years later, Bismarck’s actions as Pn1ssia’s prime minister led the vari
ous German states to be united into one country. Now Bismarck finagled
the king into letting himself be crowned emperor of Germany. Yet it was
really Bismarck who had reached the heights of power. As rigl1t—hand man
to the emperor, and as imperial chancellor zmd knighted prince, he pulled
all the levers.

lnterpretalion
Most young and ambitious politicians looking out on the political landscape
of 18405 Germany would have tried to build a power base among those
with the most power. Bismarck saw different. Joining forces with the pow-
erful can be foolish: They will swallow you up, just as the (loge of Venice
swallowed up the Count of Carmagnola. No one will come to depend on
you if they are already strong. If you are ambitious, it is much wiser to seek
out weak rulers or masters with whom you can create a relationship of do
pendency. You become their strength, their intelligence, their spine. What
power you hold! If they got rid of you the whole edifice would collapse.

Necessity rules the world. People rarely act unless compelled to. If you
create no need for yourself, then you will be done away with at first oppor-
tunity. If, on the other hand, you understand the Laws of Power and make
others depend on you for their welfare, if you can counteract their weak»
ness with your own “iron and blood,” in Bisrn-arck’s phrase, then you will
survive your masters as Bismarck did, You will have all the benefits of
power without the thorns that come from being a master.

KEYS TO POWER
The ultimate power is the power to get people to do as you wish. When you
can do this without having to force people or hurt them, when they will»
ingly grant you what you desire, then your power is untouchable. The best
way to achieve this position is to create a. relationship of dependence. The
master requires your services; he is weak, or unable to function without
you; you have enmeshed yourself in his work so deeply that doing away
with you would bring him great difficulty, or at least would mean valuable
time lost in training another to replace you. Once such a relationship is es-
tablished you have the upper hand, the leverage to make the master do as
you wish. It is the classic case of the man behind the throne, the servant of
the king who actually controls the king. Bismarck did not have to bully ei-
ther Frederick or William into doing his bidding. He simply made it clear
that unless he got what he wanted he would walk away, leaving the king to
twist in the wind. Both kings soon danced to Bismarck’s tune.

Do not be one of the many who mistakenly believe that the ultimate
form of power is independence. Power involves a relationship between
people; you will always need others as allies, pawns, or even as weak mas
ters who serve as your front. The completely independent man would live
in a cabin in the woods«—~he would have the freedom to come and go as he
pleased, but he would have no power. The best you can hope for is that
others will grow so dependent on you that you enjoy a kind of reverse in-
dependence: Their need for you frees you.

Louis XI (1423-1483), the great Spider King of France, had a weak-
ness for astrology. He kept a court astrologer whom he admired, until one
day the man predicted that a lady of the court would die within eight days.
When the prophecy came true, Louis was terrified, thinking that either the
man had murdered the woman to prove his accuracy or that he was so
versed in his science that his powers threatened Louis himself. In either
case he had to be killed.

One evening Louis summoned the astrologer to his room, high in the
castle. Before the man arrived, the king told his servants that when he gave

and hurl him to the ground, hundreds of feet below.

The astrologer soon arrived, but before giving the signal, Louis de-
cided to ask him one last question: “You claim to understand astrology and
to know the fate of others, so tell me what your fate will be and how long
you have to live.”

“I shall die just three days before Your Majesty,&quot; the astrologer replied.
The kings signal was never given. The man’s life was spared. The Spider
King not only protected his astrologer for as long as he was alive, he lav-
ished him with gifts and had him tended by the finest court doctors.

The astrologer survived Louis by several years, disproving his power

of prophecy but proving his mastery of power.

This is the model: Make others dependent on you. To get rid of you
might spell disaster, even death, and your master dares not tempt fate by
finding out. There are many ways to obtain such a position. Foremost
among them is to possess a talent and creative skill that simply cannot be
replaced.

During the Renaissance, the major obstacle to a pajntefls success was
finding the right patron. Michelangelo did this better than anyone else: His
patron was Pope julius H. But he and the pope quarreled over the building
of the pope’s marble ‘comb, and Michelangelo left Rome in disgust To the
amazement of those in the pope’s circle, not only did the pope not fire him,
he sought him out and in his own haughty way begged the artist to stay.
Michelangelo, he knew, could find another patron, but he could never find
another Michelangelo.

You do not have to have the talent of 3. Michelangelo; you do have to
have a skill that sets you apart from the crowd. You should create a situa-
tion in which you can always latch on to another master or patron but your
master cannot easily find another servant with your particular talent. And
if, in reality, you are not actually indispensable, you must find a way to
make it look as if you are. Having the appearance of specialized knowledge
and skill gives you leeway in your ability to deceive those above you into
thinking they cannot do without you. Real dependence on your master’s
part, however, leaves him more vulnerable to you than the faked variety,
and it is always within your power to make your skill indispensable.

This is what is meant by the intertwining of fates: Like creeping ivy,
you have wrapped yourself around the source of power, so that it would
cause great trauma to cut you away. And you do not necessarily have to en-
twine yourself around the master; another person will do, as long as he or
she too is indispensable in the chain.

One day Harry Colin, president of Columbia Pictures, was visited in
his office by a gloomy group of his executives. It was 1951, when the witch-
hunc against Communists in Hollywood, carried on by the US. Congress’s
House Un-American Activities Committee, was at its height. The execu-
tives had bad news: One of their employees, the screenwriterjolm Howard
Lawson, had been singled out as a Communist. They had to get rid of him
night away or suffer the wrath of the committee.

LAW 1 l

Harry Cohn was no bleeding—heart liberal; in fact, he had always been

a diehard Republican.

His favorite politician was Benito Mussolini, whom he had once vis-
ited, and whose framed photo hung on his wall. If there was someone he
hated Cohn would call him a “Communist bastard.” But to the executives’
amazement Cohn told them he would not fire Lawson. He did not keep the
screenwriter on because he was a good Writer—there were many good
writers in Hollywood. He kept him because of a chain of dependence:
Lawson was Humphrey Bogart’s writer and Bogart was Columbia’s star. If
Cohn messed with Lawson he would ruin an immensely profitable rela-
tionship. That was worth more than the terrible publicity brought to him
by his defiance of the committee.

Henry Kissinger managed to survive the many bloodlettings that went
on in the Nixon White House not because he was the best diplomat Nixon
could find—there were other fine negotiators»--and not because the two
men got along so well: They did not. Nor did they share their beliefs and
politics. Kissinger survived because he entrenched himself in so many
areas of the political structure that to do away with him would lead to
chaos. Michelangelds power was intensive, depending on one skill, his abil-
ity as an artist; Kissinger’s was extensive. He got himself involved in so
many aspects and departments of the administration that his involvement
became a card in his hand. It also made him many allies. If you can
arrange such a position for yourself, getting rid of you becomes
dangerous—all sorts of interdependencies will unravel. Still, the intensive
form of power provides more freedom than the extensive, because those
who have it depend on no particular master, or particular position of
power, for their security.

To make others dependent on you, one route to take is the secret-
intelligence tactic. By knowing other people’s secrets, by holding informa-
tion that they wouldn’t want broadcast, you seal your fate with theirs. You
are untouchable. Ministers of secret police have held this position through»
out the ages: They can make or break a king, or, as in the case of Edgar
Hoover, a president. But the role is so full of insecurities and paranoia that
the power it provides almost cancels itself out. You cannot rest at ease, and
what good is power if it brings you no peace?

One last warning: Do not imagine that your master’s dependence on
you will make him love you. In fact, he may resent and fear you. But, as
Machiavelli said, it is better to be feared than loved. Fear you can control;
love, never. Depending on an emotion as subtle and changeable as love or
friendship will only make you insecure. Better to have others depend on
you out of fear of the consequences of losing you than out of love of your
company.

such dependence than courtesy. He

The first lesson which experience

REVERSAL
The weakness of making others depend on you is that you are in some
measure dependent on them. But trying to move beyond that point means
getting rid of those above you—it means standing alone, depending on no
one. Such is the monopolistic drive of a_]. P. Morgan or ajohn D. Rocke-
feller———to drive out all competition, to be in complete control. If you can
corner the market, so much the better.

No such independence comes without a price. You are forced to isolate
yourself. Monopolies often turn inward and destroy themselves from the in-
ternal pressure. They also stir up powerful resentment, making their ene-
mies bond together to fight them. The drive for complete control is often
ruinous and fruitless. Interdependence remains the law, independence a
rare and often fatal exception. Better to place yourself in a. position of mu-
tual dependence, then, and to follow this critical law rather than look for its
reversal. You will not have the unbearable pressure ofbeing on top, and the
master above you will in essence be your slave, for kewill depend on you.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Sometime in 1926, a tall, dapperly dressed man paid a visit to Al Capone,
the most feared gangster of his time. Speaking with an elegant Continental
accent, the man introduced himself as Count Victor Lustig. He promised
that if Capone gave him $50,000 he could double it. Capone had more
than enough funds to cover the “investment,” but he wasn’t in the habit of
entrusting large sums to total strangers. He looked the count over: Same-
thing about the man was different-—-his classy style, his manna-r—and so
Capone decided to play along. He counted out {he bills personally and
handed them to Lustig. “Okay, Count,” said Capone. “Double it in sixty
days like you said.” Lustig left with the money, put it in a safe—deposit box
in Chicago, then headed to New York, where he had several other money-
making schemes in progress.

The $50,000 remained in the bank box untouched. Lustig made no ef-
fort to double it. Two months later he retumed to Chicago, took the money
from the box, and paid Capone another visit. He looked at the gangstefs
stony~faced bodyguards, smiled apologetically, and said, “Please accept my
profound regrets, Mr. Capone. I’m sorry to report that the plan failed .
. I
failed.”

.

Capone slowly stood up. He glowered at Lustig, debating which part
of the river to throw him in. But the count reached into his coat pocket,
withdrew the $50,000, and placed it on the desk. “Here, sir, is your money,
to the penny. Again, my sincere apologies. This is most embarrassing.
Things didn’t work out the way I thought they would. I would have loved
to have doubled your money for you and for myself»-—Lord knows I need
it--but the plan just didn’t materialize.”

Capone sagged back into his chair, confused. “I know you’re a con
man, Count,” said Capone. “I knew it the moment you walked in here. I
expected either one hundred thousand dollars or nothing. But this .
. get-
ting my money back .
. well.” “Again my apologies, ML Capone,” said
Lustig, as he picked up his hat and began to leave. “My God! You’re hon-
est!” yelled Capone. “If you’re on the spot, here’s five to help you along.”
He counted out five one—thousand~dollar bills out of the $50,000. The
count seemed stunned, bowed deeply, mumbled his thanks, and left, tak-
ing the money.

The $5,000 was what Lustig had been after all along.

Interpretation
Count Victor Lustig, a man who spoke several languages and prided him-
self on his refinement and culture, was one of the great con arfists of mod-
ern times. He was known for his audacity, his fearlessness, and, most
important, his knowledge of human psychology. He could size up a man in
minutes, discovering his weaknesses, and he had radar for suckers. Lustig
knew that most men build up defenses against crooks and other trouble-
makers. The con artists job is to bring those defenses down.

One sure way to do this is through an act of apparent sincerity and
honesty. Who will distrust a person literally caught in the act of being hon-

est? Lustig used selective honesty many times, but with Capone he went a
step further. No normal con man would have dared such a con; he would
have chosen his suckers for their meekness, for that look about them that
says they will take their medicine without complaint. Con Capone and you
would spend the rest of your life (whatever remained of it) afraid. But
Lustig understood that a man like Capone spends his life rrfistrusting oth-
ers. No one around him is honest or generous, and being so much in the
company of wolves is exhausting, even depressing. A man like Capone
yearns to be the recipient of an honest or generous gesture, to feel that not
everyone has an angle or is out to rob him.

Lusiig’s act of selective honesty disarmed Capone because it was so
unexpected. A con artist loves conflicting emotions like these, since the
person caught up in them is so easily distracted and deceived.

Do not shy away from practicing this law on the Capones of the world.
With a well-timed gesture of honesty or generosity, you will have the most
brutal and cynical beast in the kingdom eating out of your hand.

KEYS ’l‘(.) P()\/\&quot;l:lR
The essence of deception is distraction. Distracting the people you want to
deceive gives you the time and space to do something they won’: notice.
An act of kindness, generosity, or honesty is often the most powerful form
of distraction because it disanns other people’s suspicions. It tums them
into children, eagerly lapping up any kind of a.ft&#x27;ectiona.te gesture.

In ancient China this was called “giving before you take”--the giving
makes it hard for the other person to notice the taldng. It is a device with
infinite practical uses. Brazenly taking something from someone is danger-
ous, even for the powerful. The victim will plot revenge. It is also danger-
ous simply to ask for what you need, no matter how politely: Unless the
other person sees some gain for themselves, they may come to resent your
neediness. Learn to give before you take. It softens the ground, takes the
bite out of a future request, or simply creates a distraction. And the giving
can take many forms: an actual gift, at generous act, a kind favor, an “l1on~
est” admission-—whatever it takes.

Selective honesty is best employed on your first encounter with some
one. We are all creatures of habit, and our first impressions last a long time.
If someone believes you are honest at the start of your relationship it takes
a lot to convince them otherwise. This gives you room to maneuver.

jay Gould,

like Al Capone, was a man who distrusted everyone.
By the time he was thirty—three he was already a multimillionaire,
mostly through deception and strong-arming. In the late 1860s, Gould in-
vested heavily in the Erie Railroad, then discovered that the market had

L/SW12

91

been flooded with a vast amount of phony stock certificates for the com»
party. He stood to lose a fortune and to suffer a lot of embarrassment.

In the midst of this crisis, a man named Lord john Gordon- Gordon of-
fered to help. Gordon—Gordon, a Scottish lord, had apparently made a
small fortune investing in railroads.

By hiring some handwriting experts &#x27;Gordon—Gordon was able to
prove to Gould that the culprits for the phony stock certificates were actu-
ally several top executives with the Erie Railroad itself. Gould was grateful.
Gordon«Gordon then proposed that he and Gould join forces to buy up a
controlling interest in Erie. Gould agreed. For a while the venture ap-
peared to prosper. The two men were now good friends, and every time
Gordon—Gordon came to Gould asking for money to buy more stock,
Gould gave it to him.
In 1873, however, Gordon-Gordon suddenly
dumped all of his stock, making a fortune but drastically lowering the value
of Gould’s own holdings. Then he disappeared from sight.

Upon investigation, Gould found out that Gordon-Gordon’s real name
was john Crowningsfield, and that he was the bastard son of a merchant
Seaman and a London barmaid. There had been many clues before then
that Goi-donvGordon was a con man, but his initial act of honesty and sup
port had so blinded Gould that it took the loss of millions for him to see
through the scheme.

A single act of honesty is often not enough. What is required is a repu-
tation for honesty, built on a. series of acts-—but these can be quite inconse-
quential. Once this reputation is established, as with first impressions, it is
hard to shake.

~

In ancient China, Duke Wu of Chéng decided it was time to take over
the increasingly powerful kingdom of Ho. Telling no one of his plan, he
married his daughter to Hu’s ruler. He then called a oouncil and asked his
ministers, “I am considering a military campaign. Which country should
we invade?” As he had expected, one of his ministers replied, “H11 should
be invaded.” The duke seemed angry, and said, “Hu is a sister state now.
Why do you suggest invading her?” He had the minister executed for his
impolitic remark. The ruler of Hu heard about this, and considering other
tokens of Wu’s honesty and the marriage with his daughter, he took no pre-
cautions to defend himself from Chéng. A few weeks later, Chéng forces
swept through Hu and took the country, never to relinquish it.

Honesty is one of the best ways to disarm the wary, but it is not the
only one. Any kind of noble, apparently selfless act will serve. Perhaps the
best such act, though, is one of generosity. Few people can resist a gift, even
from the most hardened enemy, which is why it is often the perfect way to
disarm people. A gift brings out the child in us, instantly lowering our dc»
lenses. Although we often view other people’s actions in the most cynical
light, we rarely see the Machiavellian element of a gift, which quite often
hides ulterior motives. A gift is the perfect object in which to hide a decep—
live move.

Over three thousand years ago the ancient Greeks traveled across the
sea to recapture the beautiful Helen, stolen away from them by Paris, and

yet neither side had come close to victory. One day, the prophet Calchas

Selective kindness should also be part of your arsenal of deception. For
years the ancient Romans had besieged the city of the Faliscans, always un~
successfully. One day, however, when the Roman general Camillus was
encamped outside the city, he suddenly saw a man leading some children
toward him. The man was a Faliscan teacher, and the children, it turned
out, were the sons and daughters of the noblest and wealthiest citizens of
the town. On the pretense of taking these children out for a walk, he had
led them straight to the Romans, offering them as hostages in hopes of in-
gratiating himself with Camillus, the city’s enemy.

Camillus did not take the children hostage. He stripped the teadier,
tied his hands behind his back, gave each child a rod, and let them whip
him all the way back to the city. The gesture had an immediate effect on
the Faliscans. Had Camillus used the children as hostages, some in the city
would have voted to surrender. And even if the Faliscans had gone on
fighting, their resistance would have been halfhearted. Camillus’s refusal to
take advantage of the situation broke down the Faliscans’ resistance, and
they surrendered. The general had calculated correctly. And in any case he
had had nothing to lose: He knew that the hostage ploy would not have
ended the war, at least not right away. By turning the situation around, he
earned his enemy’s trust and respecg disarming them. Selective kindness
will often break down even the most stubborn foe: Aiming right for the
heart, it corrodes the will to fight back.

Remember: By playing on people’s emotions, calculated acts of kind-
ness can turn a Capone into a gullible child. As with any emotional ap-
proach, the tactic must be practiced with caution: If people see through it,
their disappointed feelings of gratitude and warmth will become the most
violent hatred and distrust Unless you can make the gesture seem sincere
and heartfelt, do not play with fire.

REVERSAL
When you have a history of deceit behind you, no amount of honesty, gen-
erosity, or kindness will fool people. In fact it will only call attention to it-
self. Once people have come to see you as deceitful, to act honest all of a
sudden is simply suspicious. In these cases it is better to play the rogue.

Count Lustig, pulling the biggest can of his career, was about to sell
the Eiffel Tower to an unsuspecting indusixialist who believed the govern-
ment was auctioning it off for scrap metal. The industrialist was prepared
to hand over a huge sum of money to Lustig, who had successfully imper-
sonated a government official. At the last minute, however, the mark was
suspicious. Something about Lustig bothered him. At the meeting in which
he was to hand over the money, Lustig sensed his sudden distrust.

Leaning over to the industrialist, Lustig explained, in a low whisper,
how low his salary was, how difficult his finances were, on and on. After a
few minutes of this, the industlialist realized that Lustig was asking for a
bribe. For the first time he relaxed. Now he knew he could trust Lustig:
Since all government officials were dishonest, Lustig had to be real. The
man forked over the money. By acting dishonest, Lustig seemed the real
McCoy. In this case selective honesty would have had the opposite effect.
As the French diplomat Talleyrand grew older, his reputation as a mas-
ter liar and deceiver spread. At the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), he
would spin fabulous stories and make impossible remarlm to people who
knew he had to be lying. His dishonesty had no purpose except to cloak
the moments when he really was deceiving them. One day, for example,
among friends, Talleyrand said with apparent sincerity, “In business one
ought to show one’s hand.” No one who heard him could believe their
ears: A man who never once in his life had shown his cards was telling
other people to show theirs. Tactics like this made it impossible to distin-
guish Talleyi-and’s real decepfions from his fake ones. By embracing his
reputation for dishonesty, he preserved his ability to deceive.

Nothing in the realm of power is set in stone. Overt deceptiveness will
sometimes cover your tracks, even making you admired for the honesty of
your dishonesty.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In the early fourteenth century, a young man named Castruccio Castracani
rose from the rank of common soldier to become lord of the great city of
Lucca, Italy. One of the most powerful families in the city, the Poggios,
had been instrumental in his climb (which succeeded through treachery
and bloodshed), but after he came to power, they came to feel he had for»
gotten them. His ambition outweighed any gratitude he felt. In 1325, while
Castruccio was away fighting Lucca’s main rival, Florence, the Poggios
conspired with other noble families in the city to rid themselves of this
troublesome and ambitious prince.

Mounting an insurrection, the plotters attacked and murdered the gov-
ernor whom Castruccio had left behind to rule the city. Riots broke out,
and the Castmccio supporters and the Poggio supporters were poised to do
battle, At the height of the tension, however, Stefano di Poggio, the oldest
member of the family, intervened, and made both sides lay down their

arms.

A peaceful man, Stefano had not taken part in the conspiracy. He had
told his family it would end in a useless bloodbath. Now he insisted he
should intercede on the family’s behalf and persuade Castruccio to listen to
their complaints and satisfy their demands. Stefano was the oldest and wis-
est member of the clan, and his family agreed to put their trust in his diplcw
macy rather than in their weapons.

When news of the rebellion reached Castruccio, he hurried back to
Lucca. By the time he arrived, however, the fighting had ceased, through
Stefa.no’s agency, and he was surprised by the city’s calm and peace. Ste-
fano di Poggio had imagined that Castruccio would be grateful to him for
his part in quelling the rebellion, so he paid the prince a visit. He explained
how he had brought peace, then begged for Castruccio’s mercy. He said
that the rebels in his family were young and impetuous, hungry for power
yet inexperienced; he recalled his family’s past generosity to Castzuccio.
For all these reasons, he said, the great prince should pardon the Poggios
and listen to their complaints. This, he said, was the only just thing to do,
since the family had willingly laid down their arms and had always sup-
ported him.

Castmccio listened patiently. He seemed not the slightest bit angry or
resentful. Instead, he told Stefano to rest assured that justice would prevail,
and he asked him to bring his entire family to the palace to talk over their
grievances and come to an agreement. As they took leave of one another,
Castruccio said he thanked God for the chance he had been given to show
his clemency and kindness. That evening the entire Poggio family came to
the palace. Castruccio immediately had them imprisoned and a few days
later all were executed, including Stefano.

Interpretation
Stefano di Poggio is the embodiment of all those who believe that the jus-
tice and nobility of their cause will prevail, Certainly appeals to justice and
gratitude have occasionally succeeded in the past, but more often than not

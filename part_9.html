    <pre>conservatism and the irrationality of habit: It is a culture of innovation. Yet
when Charles Darwin published his ideas of evolution, he faced fiercer ope
position from his fellow scientists than from religious authorities. His theo-
ries challenged too many fixed ideas. Jonas Salk ran into the same wall
with his radical innovations in immunology, as did Max Planck with his
revolutionizing of physics. Planck later wrote of the scientific opposition he
faced, “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents
and making them see the light. but rather because its opponents eventually
die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”

The answer to this innate conservatism is to play the courtier’s game.
Galileo did this at the beginning of his scientific career; he laxer became
more confrontational, and paid for it So pay lip service to tradition. Idem»
tify the elements in your revolution that can be made to seem to build on
the past. Say the right things, make a show of conformity, and meanwhile
let your theories do their radical work. Play with appearances and respect
past protocol. This is true in every arenae-science being no exception.

Finally, powerful people pay attention to the zeitgeist If their reform is
too far ahead of its time, few will understand it, and it will stir up anxiety
and be hopelessly misinterpreted. The changes you make must seem less
innovative than they are. England did eventually become a Protestant na~
tion, as Cromwell wished, but it took over a century of gradual evolution.

Watch the zeitgeist. If you work in a tumultuous time, there is power to
be gained by preaching a return to the past, to comfort, tradition, and rit-
ual. During a period of stagnation, on the other hand, play the card of re-
form and revo1ution—but beware of what you stir up. Those who finish a
revolution are rarely those who start it. You will not succeed at this danger-
ous game unless you are willing to forestall the inevitable reaction against it
by playing with appearances and building on the past.

Authority: He who desires or attempts to reform the government of a
stale, and wishes to have it accepted, must at least retain the semblance of
the old forms; so that it may seem to the people that there has been no
change in the institutions, even though in fact they are entirely different
from the old ones. For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with ap-
pearances, as though they were realities. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

Creature of habit, it loves the
warmth of the familiar. Upset its
routines, disrupt its space, and it will
grow unmanageable and psychotic.
Placate it by supporting its rituals. If
change is necessary, deceive the cat by
keeping the smell of the past alive;
place objects familiar to it in
strategic locations.

REVERSAL
The past is a corpse to be used as you see fit. If what happened in the re-
cent past was painful and harsh. it is se1f—destructive to associate yourself
with it. When Napoleon came to power, the French Revolution was fresh
in everyone’s minds. If the court that he established had borne any resem-
blance to the lavish court of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, his courtiers
would have spent all their time worrying about their own necks. Instead,
Napoleon established a court remarkable for its sobriety and lack of osten-
tation. It was the court of a man who valued work and military virtues. This
new form seemed appropriate and reassuring.

In other words, pay attention to the times. But understand: If you
make a bold change from the past, you must avoid at all costs the appear-
ance of a void or vacuum, or you will create terror. Even an ugly recent his-
tory will seem preferable to an empty space. Fill that space immediately
with new rituals and forms. Soothing and growing familiar, these will secure
your position among the masses.

Finally, the arts, fashion, and technology would seem to be areas in
which power would come from creating a radical rupture with the past and
appearing cutting edge. Indeed, such a strategy can bring great power, but
it has many dangers. It is inevitable that your innovations will be outdone
by someone else. You have little control—-someone younger and fresher
moves in a sudden new direction, making your bold innovation of yester~
day seem tiresome and tame today. You are forever playing catch-up; your
power is tenuous and short-lived. You want a power built on something
more solid. Using the past, tinkering with tradition, playing with conven-
tion to subvert it will give your creations something more than a momen-
tary appeal. Periods of dizzying change disguise the fact that a yearning for
the past will inevitably creep back in. In the end, using the past for your
own purposes will bring you more power than trying to cut it out com-
p1etely—-a. futile and self-destructive endeavor.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Joe Orton met Kenneth Halliwell at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts,
London, in 1953, where both had enrolled as acting students. They soon
became lovers and moved in together. Halliwell, twenty—five at the time,
was seven years older than Orton, and seemed the more confident of the
two; but neither had much talent as actors, and after graduating, having set~
tied down together in a dank London apartment, they decided to give up
acting and collaborate as writers instead. Halliwell’s inheritance was
enough to keep them from having to find work for a few years, and in the
beginning, he was also the driving force behind the stories and novels they
wrote; he would dictate to Orton, who would type the manuscripts, occa~
sionally interjecting his own lines and ideas. Their first efforts attracted
some interest from literary agents, but it sputtered. The promise they had
shown was leading nowhere.

Eventually the inheritance money ran out, and the pair had to look for
work. Their collaborations were less enthusiastic and less frequent. The fu~
ture looked bleak.

In 1957 Orton began to write on his own, but it wasn’t until five years
later, when the lovers were jailed for six months for defacing dozens of li-
brary books, that he began to find his voice (perhaps not by chance: This
was the first time he and Halliwell had been separated in nine years). He
came out of prison determined to express his contempt for English society
in the form of theatrical farces. He and Halliwell moved back in together,
but now the roles were reversed: Orton did the writing while Halliwell put
in comments and ideas.

In 1964 joe Orton completed his first full-length play, Entertaining Mr.
Sloane. The play made it to London’s West End, where it received brilliant
reviews: A great new writer had emerged from nowhere. Now success fol-
lowed siccess, at a dizzying pace. In 1966 Orton had a hit with his play
Loot, and his popularity soared. Soon commissions came in from all sides,
including from the Beatles, who paid Orton handsomely to write them a
film script

Everything was pointing upwards, everything except Orton’s relation»
lived together, but as Orton
ship with Kenneth Halliwell. The pair still
grew successful, Halliwell began to deteriorate. Watching his lover become
the center of attention, he suffered the humiliation of becoming a kind of
personal assistant to the playwright, his role in what had once been a col-
laboration growing smaller and smaller. In the l950s he had supported
Orton with his inheritance; now Orton supported him. At a party or
among friends, people would naturally gravitate towards Orton-—he was
charming, and his mood was almost always buoyant Unlike the handsome
Orton, Halliwell was bald and awkward; his defensiveness made people
want to avoid him.

With Orton’s success the couple‘s problems only worsened. Halliwell’s
moods made their life together impossible. Orton claimed to want to leave
him, and had numerous affairs, but would always end up returning to his

old friend and lover. He tried to help Halliwell launch a career as an artist,
even arranging for a gallery to show his work, but the show was a flop, and
this only heightened Halliwell’s sense of inferiority. In May of 1967, the
pair went on a brief holiday together in Tangier, Morocco. During the trip,
Orton wrote in his diary, “We sat milking of how happy we felt. And how it
couldn’t, surely, last. We’d have to pay for it. Or we’d be struck down from
afar by disaster because we were, perhaps, too happy. To be young, good-
looking, healthy, famous, comparatively rich and happy is surely going
against nature.”

Halliwell outwardly seemed as happy as Orton. Inwardly, though, he
was seething. And two months later, in the early morning of August 10,
1967, just days after helping Orton put the finishing touches to the wicked
fa» ce What the Butler Saw (undoubtedly his masterpiece), Kenneth Halliwell
bludgeoned joe Orton to death with repeated blows of a hammer to the
head. He then took twenty—0ne sleeping pills and died himself, leaving be-
hind a note that read, “If you read Orton’s diary all will be explained.”

Interpretation
Kenneth Halliwell had tried to cast his deterioration as mental illness, but
what joe Orton’s diaries revealed to him was the truth: It was envy, pure
and simple, that lay at the heart of his sickness. The diaries, which Halli-
well read on the sly, recounted the couple’s days as equals and their strug-
gle for recognition. After Orton found success,
the diaries began to
describe Halliwell’s brooding, his rude comments at parties, his growing
sense of inferiority. All of this Orton narrated with a distance that bordered
on contempt.

The diaries made clear Halliwe1l’s bitterness over Orton’s success.
Eventually the only thing that would have satisfied him would have been
for Orton to have a failure of his own, an unsuccessful play perhaps, so that
they could have commiserated in their failure, as they had done years be
fore. When the opposite happened—as Orton grew only more successful
and popular—Halliwell did the only thing that would make them equals
again: He made them equals in death. With Orton’s murder, he became al-
most as famous as his friend——posthumously.

Joe Orton only partly understood his l0ver’s deterioration. His attempt
to help Halliwell launch a career in art registered for what it was: charity
and guilt Orton basically had two possible solutions to the problem. He
could have downplayed his own success, displaying some faults, deflecting
I-Ialliwell’s envy; or, once he realized the nature of the problem, he could
have fled as if Halliwell were a viper, as in fact he was—a viper of envy.
Once envy eats away at someone, everything you do only makes it grow,
and day by day it festers inside him. Eventually he will attack.

Only a minority can succeed at the game of life, and that minority in-
evitably arouses the envy of those around them. Once success happens
your way, however, the people to fear the most are those in your own ctr»
cle, the friends and acquaintances you have left behind. Feelings of inferi-

power of envy.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
The merchant class and the craft guilds to which medieval Florence owed
its prosperity had created a republic that protected them from oppression
by the nobility. Since high office could only be held for a few months, no
one could gain lasting dominance, and although this meant that the politi
cal factions struggled constantly for control, the system kept out tyrants
and petty dictators. The Medici family lived for several centuries under this
system without making much of a mark. They had modest origins as
apothecaries, and were typical middle-class citizens. Not until the late four-
teenth century, when Giovanni de’ Medici made a modest fortune in bank
ing, did they emerge as a force to be reckoned with.

Upon Giova.nni’s death, his son Cosimo took over the family business,
and quickly demonstrated his talent for it. The business prospered under
his control and the Medicis emerged as one of the preeminent banking
families of Europe. But they had a rival in Florence: Despite the city’s re—
puhlican system, one family, the Albizzis, had managed over the years to
monopolize control of the government, forging alliances that allowed them
to constantly fill important offices with their own men. Cosimo did not
light this, and in fact gave the Albizzis his tacit support. At the same time,
while the Albizzis were beginning to flaunt their power, Cosimo made a
point of staying in the background.

Eventually, however, the Medici wealth could not be ignored, and in
1433, feeling threatened by the family, the Albizzis used their government
muscle to have Cosimo arrested on charges of conspiring to overthrow the
republic. Some in the Alhizzi faction wanted Cosimo executed, others
feared this would spark a civil war. In the end they exiled him from Flo-
rence. Cosimo did not fight the sentence; he left quietly. Sometimes, he
knew, it is wiser to bide one’s time and keep a low profile.

Over the next year, the Alhizzis began to stir up fears that they were
setting up a dictatorship. Meanwhile, Cosimo, using his wealth to advan-
tage, continued to exert influence on Florentine affairs, even from exile. A
civil war broke out in the city, and in September of 1434 the Albizzis were
toppled from power and sent into exile. Cosimo immediately returned to
Florence, his position restored. But he saw that he now faced a delicate sit»
uation: If he seemed ambitious, as the Albizzis had, he would stir up oppo-
sition and envy that would ultimately threaten his business. If he stayed on

the sidelines, on the other hand, he would leave an opening for another
faction to rise up as the Albizzis had, and to punish the Medicis for their

success.

Cosimo solved the problem in two ways: He secretly used his wealth
to buy influence among key citizens, and he placed his own allies, all clev-
erly enlisted from the middle classes to disguise their allegiance to him, in
top government positions. Those who complained of his growing political
clout were taxed into submission, or their properties were bought out from
under them by Cosimo’s banker allies. The republic survived in name
only. Cosimo held the strings.

While he worked behind the scenes to gain control, however, publicly
Cosimo presented another picture. When he walked through the streets of
Florence, he dressed modestly, was attended by no more than one ser-
vant, and bowed deferentially to magistrates and elder citizens. He rode a
mule instead of a horse. He never spoke out on matters of public import,
even though he controlled Florence’s foreign affairs for over thirty years.
He gave money to charities and maintained his ties to Florence’s merchant
class. He financed all ldnds of public buildings that fed the Florentines’
pride in their city. When he built a palace for himself and his family in
nearby Fiesole, he turned down the ornate designs that Brunelleschi
had drawn up for him and instead chose a modest structure designed by
Michelozzo, a man of humble Florentine origins. The palace was a symbol
of Cosimo’s strategy—all simplicity on the outside, all elegance and opu~
lence within.

Cosimo finally died in 1464, after ruling for

years. The citizens
of Florence wanted to build him a great tomb, and to celebrate his memory
with elaborate funeral ceremonies, but on his deathbed he had asked to be
buried without “any pomp or demonstration.” Some sixty years later,
Machiavelli hailed Cosimo as the wisest of all princes, “for he knew how
extraordinary things that are seen and appear every hour make men much
more envied than those that are done in deed and are covered over with

decency.”

Interpretation
A close friend of Cosimo’s, the bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci, once
wrote of him, “And whenever he wished to achieve something, he saw to it,
in order to escape envy as much as possible, that the initiative appeared to
come from others, and not from h.1&#x27;.m.” One of Cosirno’s favorite expres-
sions was, “Envy is a weed that should not be watered.” Understanding the
power envy has in a democratic environment, Cosimo avoided the appear-
ance of greatness. This does not mean that greatness should be suffocated,
or that only the mediocre should survive; only that a game of appearances
must be played. The insidious envy of the masses can actually be deflected
quite easily: Appear as one of them in style and values. Make alliances with
those below you, and elevate them to positions of power to secure their
support in times of need. Never flaunt your wealth, and carefully conceal

the degree to which it has bought influence. Make a display of deferring to
others, as if they were more powerful than you. Cosimo de’ Medici per-
fected this game; he was a consummate con artist of appearances. No one
could gauge the extent of his power———his modest exterior hid the truth.

Never be so foolish as to believe that you are stirring up admiration by
flaunting the qualities that raise you above others. By making others aware
of their inferior position, you are only stirring up “unhappy admiration,” or
envy, which will gnaw away at them until they undermine you in ways you
cannot foresee. The fool dares the gods of envy by flaunting his victories.
The master of power understands that the appearance of superiority over
others is inconsequential next to the reality of it.

Ofzzli the disorders of the soul, envy is the only one no one confesses to.
1’lul(lVt7lt. 1&#x27;. AJ). 46-120

KEYS TO POWER
The human animal has a hard time dealing with feelings of inferiority. In
the ‘face of superior skill, talent, or power, we are often disturbed and ill at
ease; this is because most of us have an inflated sense of ourselves, and
when we meet people who surpass us they make it clear to us that we are in
fact mediocre, or at least not as brilliant as we had thought. This discur~
bance in our self-image cannot last long without stirring up ugly emotions.
At first we feel envy: If only we had the quality or skill of the superior per
son, we would be happy. But envy brings us neither comfort not any closer
to equality. Nor can we admit to feeling it, for it is frowned upon socially“
to show envy is to admit to feeling inferior. To close friends, we may con-
fess our secret unrealized desires, but we will never confess to feeling envy.
So it goes underground. We disguise it in many ways, like finding grounds
to criticize the person who makes us feel it: He may be smarter than I am,
we say, but he has no morals or conscience. Or he may have more power,
but that’s because he cheats. If we do not slander him, perhaps we praise
him excessiveIy——-another of envy’s disguises.

There are several strategies for dealing with the insidious, destructive
emotion of envy. First, accept the fact that there will be people who will
surpass you in some way, and also the fact that you may envy them. But
make that feeling a way of pushing yourself to equal or surpass them some-
day. let envy turn inward and it poisons the soul; expel it outward and it
can move you to greater heights.

Second, understand that as you gain power, those below you will feel
envious of you. They may not show it but it is inevitable. Do not naively ac-
cept the facade they show you———read between the lines of their criticisms,
their little sarcastic remarks, the signs of backstabbing, the excessive praise
that is preparing you for a fall, the resentful look in the eye. Half the prob-
lem with envy comes when we do not recognize it until it is too late.

Finally, expect that when people envy you they will work against you

or that you cannot trace to their source. It is hard to defend yourself against
this kind of attack. And by the time you realize that envy is at the root of a
person’s feelings about you, it is often too late: Your excuses, your false hu-
mility, your defensive actions, only exacerbate the problem. Since it is far
easier to avoid creating envy in the first place than to get rid of it once it is
there, you should strategize to forestall it before it grows. It is often your
own actions that stir up envy, your own unawareness. By becoming con-
scious of those actions and qualities that create envy, you can take the teeth
out of it before it nibbles you to death.

Kierkegaard believed that there are types of people who create envy,
and are as guilty when it arises as those who feel it. The most obvious type
we all know: The moment something good happens to them, whether by
luck or design, they crow about it. In fact they get pleasure out of making
people feel inferior. This type is obvious and beyond hope. There are oth
ers, however, who stir up envy in more subtle and unconscious ways, and
are partly to blame for their troubles. Envy is often a problem, for exam-
ple, for people with great natural talent.

Sir Walter Raleigh was one of the most brilliant men at the court of
Queen Elizabeth of England. He had skills as a scientist, wrote poetry still
recognized as among the most beautiful writing of the time, was a proven
leader of men, an enterprising entrepreneur, a great sea captain, and on
top of all this was a handsome, dashing courtier who charmed his way into
becoming one of the queen’s favorites. Wherever he went however, pea
ple blocked his path. Eventually he suffered a terrific fall from grace, lead-
ing even to prison and finally the executioner’s axe.

Raleigh could not understand the stubborn opposition he faced from
the other courtiers. He did not see that he had not only made no attempt to
disguise the degree of his skills and qualifies, he had imposed them on one
and all, making a show of his versatility, thinking it impressed people and
won him friends. In fact it made him silent enemies, people who felt infe-
rior to him and did all they could to ruin him the moment he tripped up or
made the slightest mistake. In the end, the reason he was executed was
ueason, but envy will use any cover it finds to mask its destructiveness.

The envy elicited by Sir Walter Raleigh is the worst kind: It was in-
spired by his natural talent and grace, which he felt was best displayed in
its full flower. Money others can attain; power as well. But superior intelli-
gence, good looks, cha.rm—these are qualities no one can acquire. The nat-
urally perfect have to work the most to disguise their brilliance, displaying
a defect or two to deflect envy before it takes root. It is a common and
naive mistake to think you are charming people with your natural talents
when in fact they are coming to hate you.

A great danger in the realm of power is the sudden improvement in for
tune——an unexpected promotion, a victory or success that seems to come
out of nowhere. This is sure to stir up envy among your former peers.

When Archbishop de Retz was promoted to the rank of cardinal, in
1651, he knew full well that many of his former colleagues envied him.

Understanding the foolishness of alienating those below him, de Retz did
everything he could to downplay his merit and emphasize the role of luck
in his success. To put people at ease, he acted humbly and deferentially, as if
nothing had changed. (In reality, of course, he now had much more power
than before.) He wrote that these wise policies “produced a good effect, by
lessening the envy which was conceived against me, which is the greatest of
all secrets.” Follow de Retz’s example. Subtly emphasize how lucky you
have been, to make your happiness seem more attainable to other people,
and the need for envy less acute. But be careful not to affect a false modesty
that people can easily see through. This will only make them more envious.
The act has to be good; your humility, and your openness to those you have
left behind, have to seem genuine. Any hint of insincerity will only make
your new status more oppressive. Remember: Despite your elevated posi»
tion, it will do you no good to alienate your former peers. Power requires a
wide and solid support base, which envy can silently destroy.

Political power of any kind creates envy, and one of the best ways to
deflect it before it takes root is to seem unambitious. When Ivan the Terri-
ble died, Boris Godunov knew he was the only one on the scene who could
lead Russia. But if he sought the position eagerly, he would stir up envy
and suspicion among the boyars, so he refused the crown, not once but
several times. He made people insist that he take the throne. George Wash-
ington used the same strategy to great effect, first in refusing to keep the po-
sition of Commander in Chief of the American army, second in resisting
the presidency. In both cases he made himself more popular than ever.
People cannot envy the power that they themselves have given a person
who does not seem to desire it.

According to the Elizabethan statesman and writer Sir Francis Bacon,
the wisest policy of the powerful is to create a kind of pity for themselves,
as if their responsibilities were a burden and a sacrifice. How can one envy
a man who has taken on a heavy load for the public interest? Disguise your
power as a. kind of self—sacrifice rather than a source of happiness and you
make it seem less enviable. Emphasize your troubles and you turn a poten-
tial danger (envy) into a source of moral support (pity). A similar ploy is to
hint that your good fortune will benefit those around you. To do this you
may need to open your purse strings, like Cimon, a wealthy general in an-
cient Athens who gave lavishly in all kinds of ways to prevent people from
resenting the influence he had bought in Athenian politics. He paid a high
price to cleflect their envy, but in the end it saved him from ostracism and
banishment from the city.

The painter J. M. W. Turner devised another way of giving to deflect
the envy of his fellow artists, which he recognized as his greatest obstacle to
his success. Noticing that his incomparable color skills made them afraid to
hang their paintings next to his in exhibitions, he realized that their fear
would turn to envy, and would eventually make it harder for him to find
galleries to show in. On occasion, then, Turner is known to have temporar-
ily dampened the colors in his paintings with soot to earn him the goodwill
of his colleagues.

To deflect envy, Graciein recommends that the powerful display a
weakness, at minor social
indiscretion, a harmless vice. Give those who
envy you something to feed on, distracting them from your more impor-
tant sins. Remember: It is the reality that matters. You may have to play
games with appearances, but in the end you will have what counts: true
power. In some Arab countries, a man will avoid arousing envy by doing
as Cosimo de Medici did by showing his wealth only on the inside of his
house. Apply this wisdom to your own character.

Beware of some of envy’s disguises. Excessive praise is an almost sure
sign that the person praising you envies you; they are either setting you up
for a. fall—-it will be impossible for you to live up to their prajse——or they
are sharpening their blades behind your back. At the same time, those who
are hypercrifical of you, or who slander you publicly, probably envy you
as well. Recognize their behavior as disguised envy and you keep out of
the trap of mutual mud-slinging, or of taking their criticisms to heart. Win
your revenge by ignoring their measly presence.

Do not try to help or do favors for those who envy you; they will think
you are condescending to them. joe Orton’s attempt to help Halliwell find
a gallery for his work only intensified his lover‘s feelings of inferiority and
envy. Once envy reveals itself for what it is, the only solution is often to
flee the presence of the enviers, leaving them to stew in a hell of their own
creation.

Finally, be aware that some emrimnments are more conducive to envy
than others. The effects of envy are more serious among colleagues and
peers, where there is a veneer of equality. Envy is also destructive in demo~
cratic environments where overt displays of power are looked down upon.
Be extrasensitive in such environments. The filmmaker Ingmar Bergman
was hounded by Swedish tax authorities because he stood out in a county
where standing out from the crowd is frowned on. It is almost impossible
to avoid envy in such cases, and there is little you can do but accept it gm»
ciously and take none of it personally. As Thoreau once said, “Envy is the
tax which all distinction must pay.”

Image: A Garden of Weeds. You may not
feed them but they spread as you water
the garden. You may not see how, but
they take over, tall and ugly, pre-
venting anything beautiful from
flourishing. Before it is too late,
do not water indiscrimis
nately. Destroy the weeds
of envy by giving them

nothing to feed on.

Authority: Upon occasion, reveal a harmless defect in your charac-
ter. For the envious accuse the most perfect of sinning by having no
sins. They become an Argus, all eyes for finding fault with excel-
lence—it is their only consolation. Do not let envy burst with its own
venom—affect some lapse in valor or intellect, so as to disarm it
beforehand. You thus wave your red cape before the Horns of Envy,
(Baltasar Gracién, 1601-1658)
in order to save your immortality.

REVERSAL
The reason for being careful with the envious is that they are so indirect,
and will find innumerable ways to undermine you. But treading carefully
around them will often only make their envy worse. They sense that you
are being cautious, and it registers as yet another sign of your superiority.
That is why you must act before envy takes root.

Once envy is there, however, whether through your fault or not, it is
sometimes best to affect the opposite approach: Display the utmost disdain
for those who envy you. Instead of hiding your perfection, make it obvi-
ous. Make every new triumph an opportunity to make the envious squirm.
Your good fortune and power become their living hell. If you attain a posi-
tion of unimpeachable power, their envy will have no effect on you, and
you will have the best revenge of all: They are trapped in envy while you
are free in your power.

This is how Michelangelo triumphed over the venomous architect
Bramante, who turned Pope Julius against Michela.ngelo’s design for his
tomb. Bramante envied Michelangelo’s godlike skills, and to this one tri-
umph—the aborted tomb project—he thought to add another, by pushing
the pope to commission Michelangelo to paint the murals in the Sistine
Chapel. The project would take years, during which Michelangelo would
accomplish no more of his brilliant sculptures. Furthermore, Bramante
considered Michelangelo not nearly as skilled in painting as in sculpture.
The chapel would spoil his image as the perfect artist.

Michelangelo saw the trap and wanted to turn down the commission,
but he could not refuse the pope, so he accepted it without complaint.
Then, however, he used Bra.rnante’s envy to spur him to greater heights,
making the Sistine Chapel his most perfect work of all. Every time Bra-
mante heard of it or saw it, he felt more oppressed by his own envy—the
sweetest and most lasting revenge you can exact on the envious.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In 559 B.C., a young man named Cyrus gathered an immense army from
the scattered tribes of Persia and marched against his grandfather Astyages,
king of the Medes. He defeated Astyages with ease, had himself crowned
king of Medea and Persia, and began to forge the Persian Empire. Victory
followed victory in quick succession. Cyrus defeated Croesus, ruler of
Lydia, then conquered the Ionian islands and other smaller kingdoms; he
marched on Babylon and crushed it. Now he was known as Cyrus the
Great, King of the World.

After capturing the riches of Babylon, Cyrus set his sights on the east,
on the half-barbaric tribes of the Massagetai, a. vast realm on the Caspian
Sea. A fierce warrior race led by Queen Tomyris, the Massagetai lacked the
riches of Babylon, but Cyrus decided to attack them anyway, believing
himself superhuman and incapable of defeat. The Massagetai would fall
easily to his vast armies, making his empire immense.

In 529 B.C., then, Cyrus marched to the wide river Araxes, gateway to
the kingdom of the Massagetai. As he set up camp on the western bank, he
received a message from Queen Tomyris: “King of the Medes,” she told
him, “I advise you to abandon this enterprise, for you cannot know if in the
end it will do you any good. Rule your own people, and try to bear the
sight of me ruling mine. But of course you will refuse my advice, as the last
thing you wish for is to live in peace.” Tomyris, confident of her army’s
strength and not wishing to delay the inevitable battle, offered to withdraw
the troops on her side of the river, allowing Cyrus to cross its waters safely
and fight her army on the eastern side, if that was his desire.

Cyrus agreed, but instead of engaging the enemy directly he decided
to play a trick. The Massagetai knew few luxuries. Once Cyrus had crossed
the river and made his camp on the eastern side, he set the table for an
elaborate banquet, full of meat, delicacies, and strong wine. Then he left
his weakest troops in the camp and withdrew the rest of the army to the
river. A large Massagetai detachment soon attacked the camp and killed all
of the Persian soldiers in a fierce battle. Then, overwhelmed by the fabu—
lous feast that had been left behind, they ate and drank to their hearts’ con-
tent Later, inevitably, they fell asleep. The Persian army returned to the
camp that night, killing many of the sleeping soldiers and capturing the
rest. Among the prisoners was their general, a youth named Spargapises,
son of Qieen Tomyris.

When the queen learned what had happened, she sent a message to
Cyrus, chiding him for using tricks to defeat her army. “Now listen to me,”
she wrote, “and I will advise you for your own good: Give me back my son
and leave my country with your forces intact, and be content with your tri-
umph over a third part of the Massagetai. If you refuse, I swear by the sun
our master to give you more blood than you can drink, for all your glut-

humiliation, and so he killed himself. The news of her son’s death over»
whelmed Tomyris. She gathered all the forces that she could muster in her
kingdom, and whipping them into a vengeful
frenzy, engaged Qrms’s
troops in a violent and bloody battle. Finally, the Massagetai prevailed. In
their anger they decimated the Persian army, killing Cyrus himself.

After the battle, Tomyris and her soldiers searched the battlefield for
Cyrus’s corpse. When she found it she cut olf his head and shoved it into a
wineskin full of human blood, crying out, “Though I have conquered you
and live, yet you have ruined me by treacherously taking my son. See
now--I fulfill my threat: You have your fill of blood.” After Cyrus’s death,
the Persian Empire quickly unraveled. One act of arrogance undid all of
Cyrus’s good work.

Interpretation
There is nothing more intoxicating than victory, and nothing more dan-
gerous.

Cyrus had built his great empire on the ruins of a previous one. A hun-
dred years earlier, the powerful Assyrian Empire had been totally de«
stroyed, its once splendid capital of Nineveh but ruins in the sand. The
Assyrians had suffered this fate because they had pushed too far, destroy-
ing one city-state after another until they lost sight of the purposes of their
victories, and also of the costs. They overextended themselves and made
many enemies who were finally able to band together and destroy them.

Cyrus ignored the lesson of Assyria. He paid no heed to the warnings
of oracles and advisers. He did not worry about offending a queen. His
many victories had gone to his head, clouding his reason. Instead of con-
solidating his already vast empire, he pushed forward. Instead of recogniz-
ing each situation as different, he thought each new war would bring the
same result as the one before as long as he used the methods he knew:
ruthless force and cunning.

Understand: In the realm of power, you must be guided by reason. To
let a momentary thrill or an emotional victory influence or guide your
moves will prove fatal. When you attain success, step back. Be cautious.
When you gain victory, understand the part played by the particular cir-
cumstances of a situation, and never simply repeat the same actions again
and again. History is littered with the mins of victorious empires and the
corpses of leaders who could not learn to stop and consolidate their gains.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
No single person in history has occupied a more delicate and precarious
position than the kings mistress. She had no real or legitimate power base
to fall back on in times of trouble‘, she was surrounded by packs of envious
courtiers eagerly anticipating her fall from grace; and finally, since the
source of her power was usually her physical beauty, for most royal mis-
tresses that fall was inevitable and unpleasant.

King Louis XV of France began to keep official mistresses in the early
days of his reign, each woman’s good fortune rarely lasting more than a
few years. But then came Madame de Pompadour, who, when she was a
middle-class child of nine named jeanne Poisson, had been told by a for-
tune~teller that she would someday be the king’s favorite. This seemed an
absurd dream, since the royal mistress almost always came from the aris~
tocracy. Jeanne nevertheless believed herself destined to seduce the king,
and doing so became her obsession. She applied herselfto the talents the
king’s favorite had to have-—-music, dancing, acting, horseback riding——-
and she excelled in every one of them. As a young woman, she married a
man of the lower nobility, which gave her an entree to the best salons in
Paris. Word quickly spread of her beauty, talent, charm, and intelligence.

Jeanne Poisson became close friends with Voltaire, Montesquieu, and
other great minds of the time, but she never lost sight of the goal she had
set herself as a girl: to capture the heart of the king. Her husband had a
chateau in a forest where the king would often go hunting, and she began
to spend a lot of time there. Studying his movements like a hawk, she
would make sure he would “happen” to come upon her while she was out
walking in her most alluring dress, or riding in her splendid coach. The
king began to take note of her, making her gifts of the game he caught in
the hunt.

In 1744 Louis’s current mistress, the Duchesse de Chateauroux, died.
Jeanne went on the offensive. She placed herself everywhere he would be:
at masked balls at Versailles, at the opera, wherever their paths would
cross, and wherever she could display her many talents: dancing, singing,
riding, coquetry. The king finally succumbed to her charms, and in a cere-
mony at Versailles in September of 1745, this twenty—four—year~old daugh-
ter of a rniddleaclass banking agent was officially inaugurated as the king’s
mistress. She was given her own room in the palace, a room the king could
enter at any time via a hidden stairway and back door. And because some
of the courtiers were angry that he had chosen a woman of low origins, he
made her a marquise. From now on she would be known as Madame de
Pompadour.

The king was a man whom the slightest feeling of boredom would op-
press out of proportion. Madame de Pompadour knew that keeping him
under her spell meant keeping him amused. To that end she put on con-
stant theatrical productions at Versailles, in which she starred. She orgaw
nizecl elaborate hunting parties, masked balls, and whatever else it would
take to keep him diverted outside the bedroom. She became a patmness of
the arts, and the arbiter of taste and fashion for all of France. Her enemies
at the court only grew in number with each new success, but Madame de
Pompadour thwarted them in a totally novel way for a l-:ing’s mistress: with
extreme politeness. Snobs who resented her for her low birth she won over
with charm and grace. Most unusual of all, she befriended the queen, and
insisted that Louis XV pay more attention to his wife, and treat her more

crown her glory, the king made her a duchess. Her sway was felt even in
politics: Indeed she became the untitled minister of foreign affairs.

In 1751, when Madame de Pompadour was at the height of her power,
she experienced her worst crisis. Physically weakened by the responsibili—
ties of her position, she found it increasingly difficult to meet the king’s de~
mands in bed. This was usually the point at which the mistress would meet
her end, struggling to maintain her position as her beauty faded. But
Madame de Pompadour had a strategy: She encouraged the king to set up
a kind of brothel, Pare aux Cerfs, on the grounds of Versailles. There the
middle-aged king could have liaisons with the most beautiful young girls in
the realm.

Madame de Pompadour knew that her charm and her political acu—
men had made her indispensable to the king. What did she have to fear
from a sixteen-year-old who had none of her power and presence? Vv&#x27;hat
did it matter if she lost her position in the bedroom, as long as she re-
mained the most powerful woman in France? To secure that position she
became still closer friends with the queen, with whom she started attending
church. Although her enemies at the court conspired to have her toppled
from her official position as l&lt;ing’s mistress, the king kept her on, for he
needed her calming elfect. It was only when her part in the disastrous
Seven Years’ War drew much criticism on her that she slowly withdrew
from public affairs.

Madame de Pompadour’s health had always been delicate, and she
died at the age of forty~three, in 1764. Her reign as mistress had lasted an
unprecedented twenty years. “She was regretted by all,” wrote the Due de
Croy, “for she was kindly and helpful to everyone who approached her.”

Interpretation
Aware of the temporariness of her power, the kings mistress would often
go into a kind of frenzy after capturing the king: She would try to accumu-
late as much money as possible to protect her afler her inevitable fall. And
to extend her reign as long as possible, she would be ruthless with her ene-
mies in the court. Her situation, in other words, seemed to demand from
her a greed and vindictiveness that would often be her undoing. Madame
de Pompadour succeeded where all others had failed because she never
pressed her good fortune. Instead of bullying the courtiers from her power»
ful position as the king’s mistress, she tried to win their support. She never
revealed the slightest hint of greed or arrogance. When she could no
longer perform her physical duties as mistress, she did not fret at the
thought of someone replacing her in bed. She simply applied some strat-
egy--she encouraged the king to take young lovers, knowing that the
younger and prettier they were, the less of a threat they posed, since they
could not compare to her in charrn and sophistication and would soon
bore the monarch.

lenge your power. It makes you less able to adapt to circumstance. You
come to believe your character is more responsible for your success than
your sirategizing and planning. Like Madame de Pompadour, you need to
realize that your moment of triumph is also a moment when you have to
rely on cunning and strategy all the more, consolidating your power base,
recognizing the role of luck and circumstance in your success, and remain-
ing vigilant against changes in your good fortune. It is the moment of vic-
tory when you need to play the couttier&#x27;s game and pay more attention
than ever to the laws of power.

KEYS TO POWER
Power has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at the game
are the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will, keeping peo-
ple off balance while they set the tempo. The essence of strategy is control-
ling what comes next, and the elation of victory can upset your ability to
control what comes next in two ways. First, you owe your success to a pat»
tern that you are apt to try to repeat. You will try to keep moving in the
same direction without stopping to see whether this is still the direction that
is best for you. Second, success tends to go to your head and make you
emotional. Feeling invulnerable, you make aggressive moves that ulti-
mately undo the victory you have gained.

The lesson is simple: The powerful vary their rhythms and patterns,
change course, adapt to circumstance, and learn to improvise. Rather than
letting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step back and look
where they are going. It is as if their bloodstream bore a kind of antidote to
the intoxication of victory, letting them control their emotions and come to
a kind of mental halt when they have attained success. They steady them-
selves, give themselves the space to reflect on what has happened, examine
the role of circumstance and luck in their success. As they say in riding
school, you have to be able to control yourself before you can control the
horse.

Luck and circumstance always play a. role in power. This is inevitable,
and actually makes the game more interesting. But despite what you may
think, good luck is more dangerous than had luck. Bad luck teaches valu~
able lessons about patience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the
worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you think
your brillliance will cany you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn,
and when it does you will be completely unprepared.

According to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He had
many triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad luck to
have good luck: He had a. pope for a father. Then, when he had bad luck
for real—his fathefs death—-he was unprepared for it, and the many ene~

LAW 47

-I15

mies he had made devoured him. The good luck that elevates you or seals
your success brings the moment for you to open your eyes: The wheel of
fortune will hurtle you down as easily as up. If you prepare for the fall, it is
less likely to ruin you when it happens.

People who have a run of success can catch a kind of fever, and even
when they themselves try to stay calm, the people below them often pres—
sure them to go past their mark and into dangerous waters. You have to
have a strategy for dealing with these people. Simply preaching moderar
tion will make you look weak and small-minded; seeming to fail to follow
up on a victory can lessen your power.

When the Athenian general and statesman Pericles led a series of
naval campaigns around the Black Sea in 436 u.(:., his easy triumphs en-
flamed the Athenians’ desire for more. They dreamed of conquering
Egypt, overrunning Persia, sailing for Sicily. On the one hand Pericles
reined in these dangerous emotions by warning of the perils of hubris. On
the other hand he fed them by fighting small battles that he knew he could
win, creating the appearance that he was preserving the momentum of suc»
cess. The skill with which Pericles played this game is revealed by what
happened when he died: The demagogues Cook over, pushed Athens into
invading Sicily, and in one rash move destroyed an empire.

The rhythm of power often requires an alternation of force and cun-
ning. Too much force creates a counterreaction; too much cunning, no
matter how cunning it is, becomes predictable. Working on behalf of his
master, the shogun Oda Nobunaga, the great sixteenth-century japanese
general (and future emperor) Hideyoshi once engineered a stunning vic-
tory over the army of the formidable General Yoshimoto. The shogun
wanted to go further, to take on and crush yet another powerful enemy, but
Hideyoshi reminded him of the old Japanese saying: “When you have
won a victory, tighten the strings of your helmet.” For Hideyoshi this was
the moment for the shogun to switch from force to cunning and indirec-
tion, setting his enemies against one another through a. series of deceptive
alliances. In this way he would avoid stirring up needless opposition by
appearing overly aggressive. When you are victorious, then, lie low, and
lull
the enemy into inaction. These changes of rhythm are immensely
powerful.

People who go past the mark are often motivated by a desire to please
a master by proving their dedication. But an excess of effort exposes you to
the risk of making the master suspicious of you. On several occasions, gen-
erals under Philip of Macedon were disgraced and demoted immediately
after leading their troops to a great victory; one more such victory, Philip
thought, and the man might become a rival instead of an underling. When
you serve a master, it is often wise to measure your victories carefully, let-
ting him get the glory and never making him uneasy. It is also wise to es-
tablish a pattern of strict obedience to earn his trust. In the fourth century
B.C., a. captain under the notoriously severe Chinese general Wu Ch’i
charged ahead before a battle had begun and came back with several

416

LAW 47

enemy heads. He thought he had shown his fiery enthusiasm, but Wu Ch’i
was unimpressed. “A talented officer,” the general said with a sigh as he or-
dered the man beheaded, “but a disobedient one.”

Another moment when 3. small success can spoil the chances for a
larger one may come if a master or superior grants you a favor: It is a dan-
gerous mistake to ask for more. You will seem insecur%perhaps you feel
you did not deserve this favor, and have to grab as much as you can when
you have the chance, which may not come again. The proper response is
to accept the favor graciously and withdraw. Any subsequent favors you
should earn without having to ask for them.

Finally, the moment when you stop has great dramatic import. What
comes last sticks in the mind as a kind of exclamation point. There is no
better time to stop and walk away than after a victory. Keep going and you
risk lessening the effect, even ending up defeated. As lawyers say of cross-
examination, “Always stop with a victory.”

Authority: Princes and republics should content themselves with victory,
for when they aim at more, they generally lose. The use of insulting lan-
guage toward an enemy arises from the insolence of victory, or from the
false hope of victory, which latter misleads men as often in their actions
as in their words; for when this false hope takes possession of the mind,
it makes men go beyond the mark, and causes them to sacrifice a. cer-
tain good for an uncertain better. {Niccolo Machiavelli, 14694527)

417

REVE R SAL
As Machiavelli says, either destroy a man or leave him alone entirely. In-
flicting half punishment or mild injury will only create an enemy whose
bitterness will grow with time, and who will take revenge. When you beat
an enemy, then, make your victory complete. Crush him into nonexis
tence. In the moment of victory, you do not restrain yourself from crushing
the enemy you have defeated, but rather from needlessly advancing
against others. Be merciless with your enemy, but do not create new ene-
mies by overreaching.

There are some who become more cautious than ever after a victory,
which they see as just giving them more possessions to wony about and
protect. Your caution after victory should never make you hesitate, or lose
momentum, but rather act as a safeguard against rash action. On the other
hand, momentum as a phenomenon is greatly overrated. You create your
own successes, and if they follow one upon the other, it is your own doing.
Belief in momentum will only make you emotional, less prone to act strate»
gically, and more apt to repeat the same methods. Leave momentum for
those who have nothing better to rely upon.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
By the eighth century B.C., the city-states of Greece had grown so large and
prosperous that they had run out of land to support their expanding popu-
lations. So they turned to the sea, establishing colonies in Asia Minor,
Sicily, the Italian peninsula, even Africa. The city-state of Sparta, however,
was landlocked and surrounded by mountains. Lacking access to the
Mediterranean, the Spartans never became a seafaring people;
instead
they turned on the cities around them, and, in a series of brutal, violent
conflicts lasting more than a hundred years, managed to conquer an im-
mense area that would provide enough land for their citizens. This solution
to their problem, however, brought a new, more formidable one: How
could they maintain and police their conquered territories? The subordi-
nate peoples they ruled now outmimbered them ten to one. Surely this
horde would take a horrible revenge on them.

Sparta’s solution was to create a society dedicated to the art of war.
Spartans would be tougher, stronger, and fiercer than their neighbors. This
was the only way they could ensure their stability and survival.

When a Spartan boy reached the age of seven, he was taken from his
mother and placed in a military club where he was trained to fight and un-
derwent the strictest discipline. The boys slept on beds of reeds; they were
allotted only one outer garment to wear for an entire year. They studied
none of the arts; indeed, the Spartans banned music, and permitted only
slaves to practice the crafts that were necessary to sustain them. The only
skills the Spartans taught were those of warfare. Children seen as weaklings
were left to die in a cavern in the mountains. No system of money or trad-
ing was allowed in Sparta; acquired wealth, they believed, would sow self-
ishness and dissension, weakening their warrior discipline. The only way a
Spartan could earn a living was through agriculture, mostly on state—owned
lands, which slaves, called helots, would work for him.

The Spartans’ single-mindedness allowed them to forge the most pow-
erful infantry in the world. They marched in perfect order and fought with
incomparable bravery. Their tighbknit phalamxes could vanquish an army
ten times their size, as they proved in defeating the Persians at Thermopy-
lae. A Spartan column on the march would strike terror in the enemy; it
seemed to have no weaknesses. Yet although the Spartans proved them~
selves mighty warriors, they had no interest in creating an empire. They
only wanted to keep what they had already conquered and to defend it
against invaders. Decades would pass without a single change in the system
that had succeeded so well in preserving Spa.rta’s status quo.

At the same time that the Spartans were evolving their warlike culture,
another city—state was rising to equal prominence: Athens, Unlike Sparta,
Athens had taken to the sea, not so much to create colonies as for purposes
of trade. The Athenians became great merchants; their currency, the fa-
mous “owl coins,” spread throughout the Mediterranean. Unlike the rigid
Spartans, the Athenians responded to every problem with consummate
creativity, adapting to the occasion and creating new social forms and new

arts at an incredible pace. Their society was in constant flux. And as their
power grew, they came to pose a threat to the defense-minded Spartans.

In 4-31 B.C., the war that had been brewing between Athens and Sparta
for so long finally erupted. It lasted twenty—seven years, but after many
twists of fortune, the Spartan war machine finally emerged victorious. The
Spartans now commanded an empire. and this time they could not stay in
their shell. If they gave up what they had gained, the beaten Athenians
would regroup and rise against them, and the long war would have been
fought for naught.

After the war, Athenian money poured into Sparta. The Spartans had
been trained in warfare, not politics or economics; because they were so
unaccustomed to it, wealth and its accompanying ways of life seduced and
overwhelmed them. Spartan governors were sent to rule what had been
Athenian lands; far from home, they succumbed to the worst forms of cor-
ruption. Sparta had defeated Athens, but the fluid Athenian way of life was
slowly breaking down its discipline and loosening its rigid order. And
Athens, meanwhile, was adapting to losing its empire, managing to thrive
as a cultural and economic center.

Confused by a change in its status quo, Sparta grew weaker and
weaker. Some thirty years after defeating Athens, it lost an important battle
with the city-state of Thebes. Almost overnight, this once mighty nation
collapsed, never to recover.

Interpretation
In the evolution of species, protective armor has almost always spelled dis-
aster. Although there are a few exceptions, the shell most often becomes a
dead end for the animal encased in it; it slows the creature down, making it
hard for it to forage for food and making it a target for fast~moving preda-
tors. Animals that take to the sea or sky, and that move swiftly and unpre
djctably, are infinitely more powerful and secure.

In facing a serious problem~——controlling superior numbers—Sparta
reacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the envi-
ronment. But like a turtle, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety. They
managed to preserve stability for three hundred years, but at what cost?
They had no culture beyond warfare, no arts to relieve the tension, a con
stant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors took to the sea,
learning to adapt to a world of constant motion, the Spartans entombed
themselves in their own system. Victory would mean new lands to govern,
which they did not want; defeat would mean the end of their military ma
chine, which they did not want, either. Only stasis allowed them to survive.
But nothing in the world can remain stable forever, and the shell or system
you evolve for your protection will someday prove your undoing.

In the case of Sparta, it was not the armies of Athens that defeated it,
but the Athenian money. Money flows everywhere it has the opportunity
to go; it cannot be controlled, or made to fit a prescribed pattern. It is in-
herently chaotic. And in the long run, money made Athens the conqueror,

by infiltrating the Spartan system and corroding its protective armor. In the
battle between the two systems, Athens was fluid and creative enough to
take new forms, while Sparta could grow only more rigid until it cracked.

This is the way the world works, whether for animals, cultures, or indi-
viduals. In the face of the world’s harshness and danger, organisms of any
kind develop protection-—a coat of armor, a rigid system, a comforting rit-
ual. For the short term it may work, but for the long term it spells disaster.
People weighed down by a system and inflexible ways of doing things can

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
When World V\7ar II ended and the Japanese, who had invaded China
in 1937, had finally been thrown out, the Chinese Nationalists, lead by
Chiang Kai-shek, decided the time had come to annihilate the Chinese
Communists, their hated rivals, once and for all. They had almost suc-
ceeded in 1935, forcing the Communists into the Long March, the grueling
retreat that had greatly diminished their numbers. Although the Commu«
nists had recovered somewhat during the war against japan, it would not
be difficult to defeat them now. They controlled only isolated areas in the
countryside, had unsophisticated weaponry, lacked any military experi-
ence or training beyond mountain fighting, and controlled no important
parts of China, except areas of Manchutia, which they had managed to take
after the Japanese retreat. Chiang decided to commit his best forces in
Manclmria. He would take over its major cities and from those bases would
spread through this northern industrial region, sweeping the Communists
away. Once Manchuria had fallen the Communists would collapse.

In 1945 and ’46 the plan worked perfectly: The Nationalists easily
took the major Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though, in the face of this
critical campaign, the Communist strategy made no sense. When the Na-
tionalists began their push, the Communists dispersed to Manchuria’s most
out-of—the-way corners. Their small units harassed the Nationalist armies,
ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but these dispersed
units never linked up, making them hard to attack. They would seize a
town only to give it up a few weeks later. Forming neither rear guards I101’
vanguards, they moved like mercury, never staying in one place, elusive
and formless.

The Nationalists ascribed this to two things: cowardice in the face
of superior forces and inexperience in strategy. Mao Tse~tung, the Com»
munjst leader, was more a poet and philosopher than a general, whereas
Chiang had studied warfare in the West and was a follower of the German
military writer Carl Von Clausewitz, among others.

Yet a pattern did eventually emerge in Mao‘s attacks. After the Nation-
alists had taken the cities, leaving the Communists to occupy what was gen-
erally considered Ma.nchun‘a’s useless space, the Communists started using
that large space to surround the cities. If Chiang sent an army from one city
to reinforce another, the Communists would encircle the rescuing army.
Chia.ng’s forces were slowly broken into smaller and smaller units, isolated
from one another, their lines of supply and communication cut. The Na-
tionalists still had superior firepower, but if they could not move, what
good was it?

A kind of terror overcame the Nationalist soldiers. Commanders com-
fortably remote from the front lines might laugh ax Man, but the soldiers
had fought the Communists in the mountains, and had come to fear their
elusiveness. Now these soldiers sat in their cities and watched as their fast-
moving enemies, as fluid as water, poured in on them from all sides. There
seemed to be millions of them. The Communists also encircled the sol-
diers’ spirits, bombarding them with propaganda to lower their morale and
pressure them to desert.

The Nationalists began to surrender in their minds. Their encircled
and isolated cities started collapsing even before being directly attacked;
one after another fell in quick succession. In November of 1948, the Na-
tionalists surrendered Manchuria to the Communist»-a humiliafing blow
to the technically superior Nationalist army, and one that proved decisive
in the war. By the following year the Communists controlled all of China.

Interpretation
The two board games that best approximate the strategies of war are chess
and the Asian game of go. In chess the board is small. In comparison to go,
the attack comes relatively quickly, forcing a decisive battle. It rarely pays
to withdraw, or to sacrifice your pieces, which must be concentrated at key
areas. Go is much less formal. It is played on a large grid, with 361 inter-
sections——nearly six times as many positions as in chess. Black and white
stones (one color for each side) are placed on the board’s intersections, one
at a time, wherever you like. Once all your stories (52 for each side) are on
the board, the object is to isolate the stones of your opponent by encircling
them.

A game of go——called wet’-chi in China-can last up to three hundred
moves. The strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly;
the more complex the pattern your stories initially create on the board, the
harder it is for your opponent to understand your strategy. Fighting to con-
trol a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have to think in larger
terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually to dominate
the board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility.
With mobility you can isolate the opponent in small areas and then encir-
cle them. The aim is not to kill off the opponent’s pieces directly, as in
chess, but to induce a kind of paralysis and collapse. Chess is linear, posi-
tion oriented, and aggressive; go is nonlinear and fluid. Aggression is indi-

nent’s stones at an accelerated pace.

Chinese military strategists have been influenced by go for centuries.
Its proverbs have been applied to war time. and again; Mao Tsemzng was
an addict of wei-chi, and its precepts were ingrained in his strategies. A key
wet‘-chi concept, for example, is to use the size of the board to your advan»
tage, spreading out in every direction so that your opponent cannot fathom
your movements in a simple linear way.

“Every Chinese,” Mao once wrote, “should consciously throw himself
into this war of a jigsaw pattern” against the Nationalists. Place your men in
ajigsaw pattern in go, and your opponent loses himself trying to figure out
what you are up to. Either he wastes time pursuing you or, like Chiang Kai‘
shek, he assumes you are incompetent and fails to protect himself. And if
he concentrates on single areas, as Western strategy advises, he becomes a
sitting duck for encirclement. In the weiwhi way of war, you encircle the
enemy’s brain, using mind games, propaganda, and irritation tactics to
confuse and dishearten. This was the strategy of the Communis(s—an ap-
parent foxmlessness that disoriented and terrified their enemy.

Where chess is linear and direct, the ancient game of go is closer to the
kind of strategy that will prove relevant in a world where battles are fought
indirectly, in vast, loosely connected areas. Its strategies are abstract and
multidimensional, inhabiting a plane beyond time and space: the sl:ratc~
gist’s mind. In this fluid form of warfare, you value movement over posi-
tion. Your speed and mobility make it impossible to predict your moves;
unable to understand you, your enemy can form no strategy to defeat you.
Instead of fixing on particular spots, this indirect form of warfare spreads
out, just as you can use the large and disconnected nature of the real world
to your advantage. Be like a vapor. Do not give your opponents anything
solid to attack; watch as they exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to
cope with your elusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise
your enemies—by the time they figure out where you are and what you are
up to, it is too late.

style, in all those human phenomena representing the mood of the mo-
ment. We are constantly altering the forms we have inherited from previ-
ous generations, and these changes are signs of life and vitality. Indeed. the
things that don’t change, the forms that rigidify, come to look to us like
death, and we destroy them. The young show this most clearly: Uncom-
fortable with the forms that society imposes upon them, having no set iden-
tity, they play with their own characters, trying on a variety of masks and
poses to express themselves. This is the vitality that drives the motor of
form, creating constant changes in style.

The powerful are often people who in their youth have shown im~
mense creativity in expressing something new through a new form. Society
grants them power because it hungers for and rewards this sort of newness.
The problem comes later, when they often grow conservative and posses-
sive. They no longer dream of creating new forms; their identifies are set,
their habits congeal, and their rigidity makes them easy targets. Everyone
knows their next move. Instead of demanding respect they elicit boredom:
Get off the stage! we say, let someone else, someone younger, entertain us.
When locked in the past, the powerful look comica.l——they are overripe
fruit, waiting to fall from the tree.

Power can only thrive if it is flexible in its forms. To be formless is not
to be amorphous; everything has a form—~—it
is impossible to avoid. The
formlessness of power is more like that of water, or mercury, taking the
form of whatever is around it. Changing constantly, it is never predictable.
The powerful are constantly creating form, and their power comes from
the rapidity with which they can change. Their formlessness is in the eye of
the enemy who cannot see what they are up to and so has nothing solid to
attack. This is the premier pose of power: Lmgraspable, as elusive and swift
as the god Mercury, who could take any form he pleased and used this
ability to wreak havoc on Mount Olympus.

Human creations evolve toward abstraction, toward being more rnen~
tal and less material. This evolution is clear in art, which, in this century,
made the great discovery of abstraction and conceptualism; it can also be
seen in politics, which over time have become less overtly violent, more
complicated, indirect and cerebral. Warfare and strategy too have followed
this pattern. Strategy began in the manipulation of armies on land, posi—
tioning them in ordered forrnations; on land, strategy is relatively two di-
mensional, and controlled by topography. But all the great powers have
eventually taken to the sea, for commerce and colonization. And to protect
their trading lanes they have had to learn how to fight at sea. Maritime war-
fare requires tremendous creativity and abstract thinking, since the lines
are constantly shifting. Naval captains distinguish themselves by their abil»
ity to adapt to the literal fluidity of the terrain and to confuse the enemy
with an abstract, hard—to—ant:icipate form. They are operating in a third di-
mension: the mind.

Back on land, guerrilla warfare too demonstrates this evolution toward
abstraction. T. E. Lawrence was perhaps the first modern strategist to de-

velop the theory behind this kind of warfare, and to put it into practice. His
ideas influenced Mao, who found in his writings an uncanny Western
equivalent to wei-chi. Lawrence was working with Arabs fighting for their
territory against the Turks. His idea was to make the Arabs blend into the
vast desert, never providing a target, never collecting together in one place.
As the Turks scrambled to fight this vaporous army, they spread them-
selves thin, wasfing energy in moving from place to place. They had the su-
perior firepower but the Arabs kept the inifiative by playing cat and
mouse, giving the Turks nothing to hold on to, destroying their morale.
. . Ours should be a war of detachment,”
“Most wars were wars of contact. .
Lawrence wrote. “We were to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a
vast unknown desert, not disclosing ourselves till we attacked.”

This is the ultimate form of strategy. The war of engagement has he-
come far too dangerous and costly; indirection and elusiveness yield far
better results at a much lower cost. The main cost, in fact, is mental-—the
thinking it takes to align your forces in scattered patiems, and to under-
mine the minds and psychology of your opponents. And nothing will infu-
riate and disoxient them more than formlessness. In a world where wars of
detachment are the order of the day, formlessness is crucial.

The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself
to take nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness. When you act
defensive, you show your emotions, revealing a clear form. Your oppo-
nents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles’ heel. And they will hit
it again and again. So train yourself to take nothing personally. Never let
anyone get your back up. Be like a slippery ball that cannot be held: Let no
one know what gets to you, or where your weaknesses lie. Make your face
a formless mask and you will infuriate and disorient your scheming col-
leagues and opponents.

One man who used this technique was Baron James Rothschild. A
German Jew in Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners, Roth-
schild never took any attack on him personally or showed he had been
hurt in any way. He furthermore adapted himself to the political climate,
whatever it wa.s«——-the stiffly formal Restoration monarchy of Louis XVIII,
the bourgeois reign of Louis-Philippe, the democratic revolution of 1848,
the upstart Louis-Napoleon crowned emperor in 1852. Rothschild ac-
cepted them one and all, and blended in. He could afford to appear hypo-
critical or opportunistic because he was valued for his money, not his
politics; his money was the currency of power. While he adapted and
thrived, outwardly never showing a form, all the other great families that
had begun the century immensely wealthy were mined in the period’s
complicated shifts and turns of fortune. Attaching themselves to the past,
they revealed their embrace of a form.

Throughout history, the formless style of ruling has been most adeptly
practiced by the queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a radically diflerent
position from a. king; because she is a woman, her subjects and courtiers
are likely to doubt her ability to rule, her strength of character. If she favors

one side in some ideological struggle, she is said to be acting out of emo-
tional attachment. Yet if she represses her emotions and plays the authori-
in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still. Either by
tarian,
nature or by experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible style of gov-
erning that in the end often proves more powerful than the more direct,
male form.

Two female leaders exemplifying the forxnless style of rule are Queen
Elizabeth of England and Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. In the vi-
olent wars between Catholics and Protestants, Elizabeth steered a middle
course. She avoided alliances that would commit her to one side, and that
over time would harm the country. She managed to keep her country at
peace until it was strong enough for war. Her reign was one of the most glo-
rious in history because of her incredible capacity to adapt and her flexible
ideology.

Catherine the Great too evolved an improvisatory style of governing.
Afler she deposed her husband, Emperor Peter H, taking sole control of
Russia in 1762, no one thought she would survive. But she had no precon»
ceived ideas, no philosophy or theory to dictate her policies. Although a
foreigner (she came from Germany), she understood Russia’s moods, and
how it was changing over the years. “One must govern in such a way that
one’s people think they themselves want to do what one commands them
to do,” she said, and to do this she had to be always a step ahead of their
desires and to adapt to their resistance. By never forcing the issue, she re«
formed Russia in a strikingly short period of time.

This feminine, fomiless style of ruling may have emerged as a way of
prospering under difficult circumstances, but it has proved immensely se-
ductive to those who have served under it. Being fluid, it is relatively easy
for its subjects to obey, for they feel less coerced, less bent to their mler’s
ideology. It also opens up options where an adherence to a doctrine closes
them off. Without committing to one side, it allows the ruler to play one
enemy off another. Rigid rulers may seem strong, but with time their in-
flexibility wears on the nerves, and their subjects find ways to push them
from the stage. Fle&gt;u&#x27;ble, formless rulers will be much criticized, but they
will endure, and people will eventually come to identify with them, since
they are as their subjects are--changing with the wind, open to circum-
stance.

Despite upsets and delays, the permeable style of power generally tri~
umphs in the end, just as Athens eventually won victory over Sparta
through its money and its culture. When you find yourself in conflict with
someone stronger and more rigid, allow them a momentary victory. Seem
to bow to their superiority. Then, by being formless and adaptable, slowly
insinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will catch them off guard,
for rigid people are always ready to ward of‘! direct blows but are helpless
against the subtle and insinuating. To succeed at such a strategy you must
play the cha.meleon—conform on the surface, while breaking down your
enemy from the inside.

For centuries the Japanese would accept foreigners graciously, and ap—
peared susceptible to foreign cultures and influences. joao Rodriguez, a
Portuguese priest who arrived in japan in 1577 and lived there for many
years, wrote, “I am flabbergasted by the Japanese willingness to my and ac-
cept everything Portuguese.” He saw japanese in the streets wearing Por—
tuguese clothing, with rosary beads at their necks and crosses at their hips.
This might seem like a weak, mutable culture, but ]apa.n’s adaptability
actually protected the country from having an alien culture imposed by
military invasion. It seduced the Portuguese and other Westerners into be-
lieving the japanese were yielding to a superior culture when actually the
foreign culture’s ways were merely a fashion to be donned and doffed.
Under the surface, Japanese culture thrived. Had the Japanese been rigid
about foreign influences and tried to fight them off, they might have suf-
fered the injuries that the West inflicted on China. That is the power of
i&#x27;ormlessness—~—it gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to hit.
In evolution, largeness is often the first step toward extinction. What is
immense and bloated has no mobility, but must constantly feed itself. The
unintelligent are often seduced into believing that size connotes power, the
bigger the better.

In 4-83 13.0., King Xerxes of Persia invaded Greece, believing he could
conquer the country in one easy campaign. After all, he had the largest
army ever assembled for one invasion-—the historian Herodotus estimated
it at over more than five million. The Persians planned to build a bridge
across the l-Iellespont to overrun Greece from the land, while their equally
immense navy would pin the Greek ships in harbor, preventing their
forces from escaping to sea. The plan seemed sure, yet as Xerxes prepared
the invasion, his adviser Artabanus warned his master of grave misgivings:
“The two mightiest powers in the world are against you,” he said. Xerxes
laughed-—what powers could match his gigantic army? “I will tell you what
they are,” answered Artabanus. “The land and the sea.&quot; There were no safe
harbors large enough to receive Xerxes‘ fleet. And the more land the Per-
sians conquered, and the longer their supply lines stretched, the more ru-
inous the cost of feeding this immense army would prove.

Thinking his adviser a coward, Xerxes proceeded with the invasion.
Yet as Artabanus predicted, bad weather at sea decimated the Persian fleet,
which was too large to take shelter in any harbor. On land, meanwhile, the
Persian army destroyed everything in its path, which only made it impossi—
hie to feed, since the destruction included crops and stores of food. it was
also an easy and slowqnoving target. The Greeks practiced all kinds of de
ceptive maneuvers to disorient the Persians. Xerxes’ eventual defeat at the
hands of the Greek allies was an immense disaster. The story is emblematic
of all those who sacrifice mobility for size: The flexible and fleet of foot will
almost always win, for they have more strategic options. The more gigantic
the enemy, the easier it is to induce collapse.

The need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as we
grow more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a form.

We become predictable, always the First sign of decrepitude. And pre~
dictability makes us appear comical. Although ridicule and disdain might
seem mild forms of attack, they are actually potent weapons, and will even~
tually erode a foundation of power. An enemy who does not respect you
will grow bold, and boldness makes even the smallest animal dangerous.

The late-eighteenth-ceniniry court of France, as exemplified by Marie-
Antoinette, had become so hopelessly tied to a rigid formality that the
average Frenchman thought it a silly relic. This depreciation of 21 centuries-
old institution was the first sign of a terminal disease, for it represented a
symbolic loosening of the people’s lies to monarchy. As the situation wors-
ened, Marie-Antoinette and King Louis XVI grew only more rigid in their
adherence to the past—and quickened their path to the guillotine. King
Charles I of England reacted similarly to the tide of democratic change
brewing in England in the 1630s: He disbanded Parliament, and his court
rituals grew increasingly formal and distant. He wanted to return to an
older style of ruling, with adherence to all kinds of petty protocol. His
rigidity only heightened the desire for change. Soon, of course, he was
swept up in a devastating civil war, and eventually he lost his head to the
executioner’s axe.

As you get older, you must rely even less on the past Be vigilant lest
the form your character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not a matter
of mimicking the fashions of youtl1—that is equally worthy of laughter.
Rather your mind must constantly adapt to each circumstance, even the in-
evitable change that the time has come to move over and let those of
younger age prepare for their ascendancy. Rigidity will only make you
look uncannily like a cadaver.

Never forget, though, that fonnlessuess is a strategic pose. It gives you
room to create tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to guess your
next move, they reveal their own strategy, putting them at a decided disad—
vantage. It keeps the initiative on your side, putting your enemies in the
position of never acting, constantly reacting. It foils their spying and intelli-
gence. Remember: Formlessness is a tool. Never confuse it with a go~with-
the~llow style, or with a religious resignation to the twists of fortune. You
use formlessness, not because it creates inner harmony and peace, but be-
cause it will increase your power.

Finally,

learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing
events through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people
constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out
the laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell you what to do,
and the sage advice of the elder. “The laws that govern circumstances are
abolished by new circumstances,” Napoleon wrote, which means that it is
up to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too much on other people’s
ideas and you end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much re«
spect for other people’s wisdom will make you depreciate your own. Be
brutal with the past, especially your own, and have no respect for the
philosophies that are foisted on you from outside.

REVERSAL
Using space to disperse and create an abstract pattern should not mean for-
saking the concentration of your power when it is valuable to you. Form~
lessness makes your enemies hunt all over for you, scattering their own
forces, mental as well as physical. When you finally engage them, though,
hit them with a powerful, concentrated blow. That is how Mao succeeded
against the Nationalists: He broke their forces into small, isolated units,
which he then could easily overwhelm with a strong attack. The law of con—
centration prevailed.

When you play with formlessness, keep on top of the process, and
keep your longeterm strategy in mind. When you assume a form and go on
the attack, use concentration, speed, and power. As Man said, “When we
fight you, we make sure you can’t get away.”

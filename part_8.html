minister and France’s most able diplomat. He had shown her too little re-
spect. As time went by, swindlers and Charlatans made their nests in Ver-
sailles, and enticed Louis’s interest in astrology, the occult, and fraudulent
business deals. The young and pampered teenager who had taken over
France years before had only grown worse with age.

The motto that became attached to Louis’s reign was ‘.&#x27;Apré.r moi, It
de’lugz&quot;——“After me the flood,” or, Let France rot after I am gone. And in
deed when Louis did go, in 1774, worn out by debauchery, his country and
his own finances were in horrible disarray. His grandson Louis XVI inher-
ited a realm in desperate need of reform and a strong leader. But Louis
XVI was even weaker than his grandfather, and could only watch as the
country descended into revolution. In 1792 the republic introduced by the
French Revolution declared the end of the monarchy, and gave the king a
new name, “Louis the Last” A few months later he kneeled on the guillo-
tine, his about—to—be—severed head stripped of all the radiance and power
that the Sun King had invested in the crown.

Interpretation
From a country that had descended into civil war in the late 1640s, Louis
XIV forged the mightiest realm in Europe. Great generals would tremble
in his presence. A cook once made a mistake in prepaiing a dish and com-
mitted suicide rather than face the king’ 5 wrath. Louis XIV had many mis—
tresses, but their power ended in the bedroom. He filled his court with the
most brilliant minds of the age. The symbol of his power was Versailles:
Refusing to accept the palace of his forefathers, the Louvre, he built his
own palace in what was then the middle of nowhere, symbolizing that this
was a. new order he had founded, one without precedent He made Ver-
sailles the centerpiece of his reign, a place that all the powerful of Europe
envied and visited with a sense of awe. In essence, Louis took a great
void—the decaying monarchy of France—-and filled it with his own sym~
hols and radiant power.

Louis XV, on the other hand, symbolizes the fate of all those who in»
herit something large or who follow in a great man’s footsteps. It would
seem easy for a son or successor to build on the grand foundation lefi for
them, but in the realm of power the opposite is true. The pampered, in-
dulged son almost always squanders the inheritance, for he does not start
with the father’s need to fill a void. As Machiavelli states, necessity is what
impels men to take action, and once the necessity is gone, only rot and
decay are left. Having no need to increase his store of power, Louis XV in—
evitably succumbed to inertia. Under him, Versailles, the symbol of the
Sun K.ing’s authority, became a pleasure palace of incomparable banality,
a kind of Las Vegas of the Bourbon monarchy. It came to represent all that
the oppressed peasantry of France hated about their king, and during the
Revolution they looted it with glee.

Louis XV had only one way out of the trap awaiting the son or succes-
sor of a man like the Sun King: to psychologically begin from nothing, to

denigrate the past and his inheritance, and to move in a totally new direct»

better to avoid the situation altogether, to place yourself where there is a
vacuum of power, where you can be the one to bring order out of chaos
without having to compete with another star in the sky. Power depends on
appearing larger than other people, and when you are lost in the shadow of
the father, the king, the great predecessor, you cannot possibly project such
a presence.

OBSERVANCF. OF THE LAW
Alexander the Great had a dominant passion as a young man—~an intense
dislike for his father, King Philip of Macedonia. He hated Philip’s cunning,
cautious style of ruling, his bombastic speeches, his drinking and whoring,
and his love of wrestling and of other wastes of time. Alexander knew he
had to make himself the very opposite of his domineering father: He would
force himself to be bold and reckless, he would control his tongue and be a
man of few words, and he would not lose precious time in pursuit of plea-
sures that brought no glory. Alexander also resented the fact that Philip
had conquered most of Greece: “My father will go on conquering till there
is nothing extraonhnary left for me to do,” he once complained. Vllhile
other sons of powerful men were content to inherit wealth and live a life of
leisure, Alexander wanted only to outdo his father, to obliterate Philip’s
name from history by surpassing his accomplishments.

Alexander itched to show others how superior he was to his father. A
Thessalian h0rse»dealer once brought a prize horse named Bucephalus to
sell to Philip. None of the king’s grooms could get near the horse—it was
far too savage——a.nd Philip berated the merchant for bringing him such a
useless beast. Watching the whole affair, Alexander scowled and com-
mented, “What a horse they are losing for want of skill and spirit to man‘
age him!” When he had said this several times, Philip had finally had
enough, and challenged him to take on the horse. He called the merchant
back, secretly hoping his son would have a nasty fa.ll and learn a bitter les-
son. But Alexander was the one to teach the lesson: Not only did he mount
Bucephalus, he managed to ride him at full gallop, taming the horse that
would later carry him all the way to India. The courtiers applauded wildly,
but Philip seethed inside, seeing not a son but a rival to his power.

Alexander’s defiance of his father grew bolder. One day the two men
had a heated argument before the entire court, and Philip drew his sword
as if to strike his son; having drunk too much wine, however, the king
stumbled. Alexander pointed at his father and jeered, “Men of Macedonia,

see there the man who is preparing to pass from Europe to Asia. He cannot
pass from one table to another without falling.”

When Alexander was eighteen, a disgruntled courtier murdered
Philip. As word of the regicide spread through Greece, city after city rose
up in rebellion against their Macedonian rulers. Philip’s advisers counseled
Alexander, now the king, to proceed cautiously, to do as Philip had done
and conquer through cunning. But Alexander would do things his way: He
marched to the furthest reaches of the kingdom, suppressed the rebellious
towns, and reunited the empire with brutal efficiency.

As a young rebel grows older, his struggle against the father often
wanes, and he gradually comes to resemble the very man he had wanted to
defy. But Alexandefs loathing of his father did not end with Phi.lip’s death.
Once he had consolidated Greece, he set his eyes on Persia, the prize that
had eluded his father, who had dreamed of conquering Asia. If he defeated
the Persians, Alexander would finally surpass Philip in glory and fame.

Alexander crossed into Asia with an army of 35,000 to face 3. Persian
force numbering over a million. Before engaging the Persians in battle he
passed through the town of Gordium. Here, in the town’s main temple,
there stood an ancient chariot tied with cords made of the rind of the cor-
nel tree. Legend had it that any man who could undo these cords——the
Gordian knot—~would rule the world. Many had tried to untie the enor
mous and intricate knot, but none had succeeded. Alexander, seeing he
could not possibly untie the knot with his bare hands, took out his sword
and with one slash cut it in half. This symbolic gesture showed the world
that he would not do as others, but would blaze his own path.

Against astounding odds, Alexander conquered the Persians. Most ex-
pected him to stop there--it was a great triumph, enough to secure his
fame for eternity. But Alexander had the same relationship to his own
deeds as he had to his father: His conquest of Persia represented the past,
and he wanted never to rest on past triumphs, or to allow the past to out-
shine the present. He moved on to India, extending his empire beyond all
known limits. Only his disgruntled and weary soldiers prevented him from
going farther.

Interpretation
Alexander represents an extremely uncommon type in history: the son of
a famous and successful man who manages to surpass the father in glory
and power. The reason this type is uncommon is simple: The father most
often manages to amass his fortune, his kingdom, because he begins with
little or nothing. A desperate urge irnpels him to succeed»-he has nothing
to lose by cunning and impetuousness, and has no famous father of his
own to compete against. This kind of man has reason to believe in
himself-—-to believe that his way of doing things is the best, because, after
all, it worked for him.

When a man like this has a son, he becomes domineering and oppres
imposing his lessons on the son, who is starting off life in circums
sive,
stances totally different from those in which the father himself began.

Instead of allowing the son to go in a new direction, the father will try to
put him in his own shoes, perhaps secretly wishing the boy will fail, as
Philip half wanted to see Alexander thrown from Bucephalus. Fathers envy
their sons’ youth and vigor, after all, and their desire is to control and dom-
inate. The sons of such men tend to become cowed and cautious, terrified
of losing what their fathers have gained.

The son will never step out of his father’s shadow unless he adopts the
ruthless strategy of Alexander: disparage the past, create your own king-
dom, put the father in the shadows instead of letting him do the same to
you. If you cannot materially start from ground zero—--it would be foolish
to renounce an inheritance-—you can at least begin from ground zero psy-
chologically, by throwing off the weight of the past and charting a new di—
rection. Alexander instinctively recognized that privileges of birth are
impediments to power. Be merciless with the past, then——not only with
your father and his father but with your own earlier achievements. Only
the weak rest on their laurels and dote on past triumphs; in the game of
power there is never time to rest

KEYS TO POWER
In many ancient kingdoms, for example Bengal and Sumatra, after the
king had ruled for several years his subjects would execute him. This was
done partly as a ritual of renewal, but also to prevent him from growing too
powerful—for the king would generally try to establish a permanent order,
at the expense of other families and of his own sons. Instead of protecting
the tribe and leading it in times of war, he would attempt to dominate it.
And so he would be beaten to death, or executed in an elaborate ritual.
Now that he was no longer around for his h0l101‘S to go to his head, he
could be worshipped as a god. Meanwhile the field had been cleared for a
new and youthful order to establish itself.

The ambivalent, hostile attitude towards the king or father figure also
finds expression in legends of heroes who do not know their father. Moses,
the archetypal man of power, was found abandoned among the bulrushes
and never knew his parents; without a. father to compete with him or limit
him, he could attain the heights of power. Hercules had no earthly father——
he was the son of the god Zeus. Later in his life Alexander the Great spread
the story that the god Jupiter Ammon had sired him, not Philip of Mace-
don. Legends and rituals like these eliminate the human father because he
symbolizes the destructive power of the past.

The past prevents the young hero from creating his own world--he
must do as his father did, even after that father is dead or powerless. The
hero must how and scrape before his predecessor and yield to tradition
and precedent. What had success in the past must be carried over to the
present, even though circumstances have greatly changed. The past also
weighs the hero down with an inheritance that he is terrified of losing,
making him timid and cautious.

Power depends on the ability to fill a void, to occupy a field that has

been cleared of the dead weight of the past. Only after the father figure has
been properly done away with will you have the necessary space to create
and establish a new order. There are several strategies you can adopt to ac-
complish this—-——varia!ions on the execution of the king that disguise the vio~
lence of the impulse by channeling it in socially acceptable forms.

Perhaps the simplest way to escape the shadow of the past is simply to
belittle it, playing on the timeless antagonism between the generations, stir—
ring up the young against the old. For this you need a convenient older fig-
ute to pillory. Mao Tse—tung, confronting a culture that fiercely resisted
change, played on the suppressed resentment against the overbearing pres-
ence of the venerable Confucius in Chinese culture. john F. Kennedy
knew the dangers of getting lost in the past; he radically distinguished his
presidency from that of his predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and also
from the preceding decade,
the 19505, which Eisenhower personified.
Kennedy, for instance, would not play the dull and fatherly game of golf——
a symbol of retirement and privilege, and Eisenhowefs passion. Instead he
played football on the White House lawn. In every aspect his administra-
tion represented vigor and youth, as opposed to the stodgy Eisenhower.
Kennedy had discovered an old truth: The young are easily set against the
old, since they yearn to make their own place in the world and resent the
shadow of their fathers.

The distance you establish from your predecessor often demands
some symbolism, a way of advertising itself publicly. Louis XIV, for exam-
ple, created such symbolism when he rejected the traditional palace of the
French kings and built his own palace of Versailles. King Philip II of Spain
did the same when he created his center of power, the palace of El Esco-
rial, in what was then the middle of nowhere. But Louis carried the game
further: He would not be a king like his father or earlier ancestors, he
would not wear a crown or carry a scepter or sit on a throne, he would es-
tablish a new kind of imposing authority with symbols and rituals of its
own. Louis made his ancestors’ rituals into laughable relics of the past. Fol-
low his example: Never let yourself be seen as following your predeces-
sor’s path. If you do you will never surpass him. You must physically
demonstrate your difference, by establishing a style and symbolism that
sets you apart.

The Roman emperor Augustus, successor to Julius Caesar, understood
this thoroughly. Caesar had been a great general, a theatrical figure whose
spectacles kept the Romans entertained, an international emissary seduced
by the charms of Cleopat:ra~a largerlhanalife figure. So Augustus, despite
his own theatrical tendencies, competed with Caesar not by trying to outdo
him but by differentiating himself from him: He based his power on a re-
turn to Roman simplicity, an austerity of both style and substance. Against
the memory of Caesars sweeping presence Augustus posed a quiet and
manly dignity.

The problem with the overbearing predecessor is that he fills the vistas
before you with symbols of the past. You have no room to create your own
name. To deal with this situation you need to hunt out the vacuums»-wthose

areas in culture that have been left vacant and in which you can become
the first and principal figure to shine.

When Pericles of Athens was about to launch a career as a statesman,
he looked for the one thing that was missing in Athenian politics. Most of
the great politicians of his time had allied themselves with the aristocracy;
indeed Pericles himself had aristocratic tendencies. Yet he decided to throw
in his hat with the city’s democratic elements. The choice had nothing to
do with his personal beliefs, but it launched him on a brilliant career. Out
of necessity he became a man of the people. Instead of compefing in an
arena filled with great leaders both past and present, he would make a
name for himself where no shadows could obscure his presence.

When the painter Diego de Velazquez began his career, he knew he
could not compete in refinement and technique with the great Renaissance
painters who had come before him. Instead he chose to work in a style that
by the standards of the time seemed coarse and rough, in a way that had
never been seen before. And in this style he excelled. There were mem-
bers of the Spanish court who wanted to demonstrate their own break with
the past; the newness of Velé.zquez’s style thrilled them. Most people are
afraid to break so boldly with tradition, but they secretly admire those who
can break up the old forms and reinvigorate the culture. This is why there
is so much power to be gained from entering vacuums and voids.

There is a kind of stubborn stupidity that recurs throughout history,
and is a strong impediment to power: The superstitious belief that if the
person before you succeeded by doing A, B, and C, you can re-create their
success by doing the same thing. This cookie-cutter approach will seduce
the uncreative, for it is easy, and appeals to their timidity and their laziness.
But circumstances never repeat themselves exactly.

When General Douglas MacArthur assumed command of American
forces in the Philippines during World War II, an assistant handed him a
book containing the various precedents established by the commanders
before him, the methods that had been successful for them. MacArthur
asked the assistant how many copies there were of this book. Six, the assis-
tant answered. “Well,” the general replied, “you get all those six copies to-
gether and burn them—-every one of
I’ll not be ‘bound by
precedents. Any time a problem comes up, I’ll make the decision at
once—immediately.” Adopt this ruthless strategy toward the past: Bum all
the books, and train yourself to react to circumstances as they happen.

them.

You may believe that you have separated yourself from the predeces
sor or father figure, but as you grow older you must be eternally vigilant
lest you become the father you had rebelled against. As a young man, Mao
Tse-tung disliked his father and in the struggle against him found his own
identity and a new set of values. But as he aged, his father’s ways crept back
in. Mao’s father had valued manual work over intellect; Mao had scoffed at
this as a young man, but as he grew older he unconsciously returned to his
father’s views and echoed such outdated ideas by forcing a whole genera.»
tion of Chinese intellectuals into manual labor, a nightmarish mistake that

354

LAW 41

cost his regime dearly. Remember: You are your own father. Do not let
yourself spend years creating yourself only to let your guard down and
allow the ghost of the past—father, habit, history—to sneak back in.

Finally, as noted in the story of Louis XV, plenitude and prosperity
tend to make us lazy and inactive: When our power is secure we have no
need to act. This is a serious danger, especially for those who achieve suc-
cess and power at an early age. The playwright Tennessee Williams, for in-
stance, found himself skyrocketed from obscurity to fame by the success of
The Glass Menagerie. “The sort of life which I had had previous to this popuv
lar success,” he later wrote, “was one that required endurance, a life of
clawing and scratching, but it was a good life because it was the sort of life
for which the human organism is created. I was not aware of how much
vital energy had gone into this struggle until the struggle was removed.
This was security at last. I sat down and looked about me and was suddenly
very depressed.” Williams had a nervous breakdown, which may in fact
have been necessary for him: Pushed to the psychological edge, he could
start writing with the old vitality again, and he produced A Streetcar Named
Desire. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, similarly, whenever he wrote a successful
novel, would feel that the financial security he had gained made the act of
creation unnecessary. He would take his entire savings to the casino and
would not leave until he had gambled away his last penny. Once reduced
to poverty he could write again.

It is not necessary to go to such extremes, but you must be prepared to
return to square one psychologically rather than growing fat and lazy with
prosperity. Pablo Picasso could deal with success, but only by constantly
changing the style of his painting, often breaking completely with what
had made him successful before. How often our early triumphs turn us
into a kind of caricature of ourselves. Powerful people recognize these
traps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle constantly to re—create them-
selves. The father must. not be allowed to return; he must be slain at every
step of the way.

REVE RSAL
The shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if it is cho-
sen as a trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought you power
Napoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious grand-uncle
Napoleon Bonaparte to help him become first president and then emperor
of France. Once on the throne, however, he did not stay tied to the past’, he
quickly showed how different his reign would be, and was careful to keep
the public from expecting him to attain the heights that Bonaparte had at-
tained.

The past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that would
be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even Alexander
the Great recognized and was influenced by his father’s skill in organizing
an army. Making a display of doing things differently from your predeces-
sor can make you seem childish and in fact out of control, unless your ac-
tions have a logic of their own.

Joseph II, son of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, made a show of
doing the exact opposite of his mother—dressing like an ordinary citizen,
staying in inns instead of palaces, appearing as the “people’s emperor”
Maria Theresa, on the other hand, had been regal and aristocratic. The
problem was that she had also been beloved, an empress who ruled wisely

The great Baroque artist and architect Pietro Bemini was a master at
sniffing out younger potential rivals and keeping them in his shadow. One
day a young stonemason named Francesco Boiromini showed Bernini his
architectural sketches. Recognizing his talent
in-
stantly hired Borromini as his assistant, which delighted the young man but
was actually only a tactic to keep him close at hand, so that he could play
psychological games on him and create in him a kind of inferiority com~
plex. And indeed, despite Borromini’s brilliance, Bernini has the greater
fame. His strategy with Boirornini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing that
the great sculptor Alessandro Algardi, for example, would eclipse him in
fame, he arranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his assistant.
And any assistant who rebelled against Bernini and tried to strike out on
his own would find his career ruined.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
Near the end of the sixth century B.C., the city-state of Athens overthrew
the series of petty tyrants who had dominated its politics for decades. It es-
tablished instead a democracy that was to last over a century, a dernoc»
racy that became the source of its power and its proudest achievement.
But as the democracy evolved, so did a problem the Athenians had never
faced: How to deal with those who did not concern themselves with the
cohesion of a small city surrounded by enemies, who did not work for its
greater glory, but thought of only themselves and their own ambitions and
petty intrigues? The Athenians understood that these people, if left alone,
would sow dissension, divide the city into factions, and stir up anxieties,
all of which could lead to the ruin of their democracy.

Violent punishment no longer suited the new, civilized order that
Athens had created. Instead the citizens found another, more satisfying,
and less brutal way to deal with the chronically selfish: Every year they
would gather in the marketplace and write on a piece of earthenware, an
astralcon, the name of an individual they wanted to see banished from the
city for ten years. If a particular name appeared on six thousand ballots,
that person would instantly be exiled. If no one received six thousand
votes, the person with the most artmka recording his name would suffer
the ten-year “ostracism.” This ritual expulsion became a kind of festival—-
what a joy to be able to banish those irritating, anxie ~inducing individu-
als who wanted to rise above the group they should have served.

In 490 8.0, Aristides, one of the great generals of Athenian history,
helped defeat the Persians at the battle of Marathon. Meanwhile, off the
battlefield, his fairness as a judge had earned him the nickname “The
just.” But as the years went by the Athenians came to dislike him. He
made such a Show of his righteousness, and this, they believed, disguised
his feelings of superiority and scorn for the common folk. His omnipres-
ence in Athenian politics became obnoxious; the citizens grew tired of
hearing him called “The just.” They feared that this was just the type of
man——judgmental, haughty—who would eventually stir up fierce divi-
sions among them, In 482 B.C., despite Aristides’ invaluable expertise in
the continuing war with the Persians, they collected the ostraka and had
him banished.

‘

After Aristides’ ostracism, the great general Themistocles emerged as
the city’s premier leader. But his many honors and victories went to his
head, and he too became arrogant and overbearing, constantly reminding
the Athenians of his triumphs in battle, the temples he had built, the dan-
gers he had fended oil. He seemed to be saying that without him the city
would come to ruin. And so, in 472 B.C., Thernistocles’ name was filled in
on the ostra/ca and the city was rid of his poisonous presence.

The greatest political figure in fifth-century Athens was undoubtedly
Pericles. Although several times threatened with ostranism, he avoided
that fate by maintaining close ties with the people. Perhaps he had learned
a lesson as a child from his favorite tutor, the incomparable Damon, who

excelled above all other Athenians in his intelligence, his musical skills,
and his rhetorical abilities, It was Damon who had trained Pericles in the
arts of ruling. But he, too, suffered ostracism, for his superior airs and his
insulting manner toward the commoners stirred up too much resentment.
Toward the end of the century there lived a man named Hyperbolus.
Most writers of the time describe him as the city’s most worthless citizen:
He did not care what anyone thought of him, and slandered whomever he
disliked. He amused some, but irritated many more. In 417 B.C., Hyperbo-
lus saw an opportunity to stir up auger against the two leading politicians
of the time, Alcibiades and Nicias. He hoped that one of the two would be
ostracized and that he would rise in that man’s place. His campaign
seemed likely to succeed: The Athenians disliked Alcibiades’ flamboyant
and carefree lifestyle, and were wary of Nicias’ wealth and aloofness.
They seemed certain to ostracize one or the other. But Alcibiades and
Nicias, although they were otherwise enemies, pooled their resources and
managed to turn the ostracism on Hyperbolus instead. His obnoxious-
ness, they argued, could only be terminated by banishment.

Earlier sufferers of ostracism had been formidable, powerful men.
Hyperbolus, however, was a low buffoon, and with his banishment the
Athenians felt that ostracism had been degraded. And so they ended the
practice that for nearly a hundred years had been one of the keys to keep-
ing the peace within Athens.

Interpretation
The ancient Athenians had social instincts unknown toclay—the passage
of centuries has blunted them. Citizens in the true sense of the word, the
Athenians sensed the dangers posed by asocial behavior, and saw how
such behavior often disguises itself in other forms: the holier-tharythou at-
titude that silently seeks to impose its standards on others; overweening
ambition at the expense of the common good; the flaunting of superiority;
quiet scheming; terminal obnoxiousness. Some of these behaviors would
eat away at the city’s cohesion by creating factions and sowing dissension,
others would ruin the democratic spirit by making the common citizen
feel inferior and envious. The Athenians did not try to reeducate people
who acted in these ways, or to absorb them somehow into the group, or to
impose a violent punishment that would only create other problems. The
solution was quick and effective: Get rid of them.

Within any group, trouble can most often be traced to a single source,
the unhappy, chronically dissatisfied one who will always stir up dissen-
sion and infect the group with his or her ill ease. Before you know what hit
you the dissatisfaction spreads. Act before it becomes impossible to disen-
tangle one strand of misery from another, or to see how the whole thing
started. First, recognize troublemakers by their overbearing presence, or
by their complaining nature. Once you spot them do not try to reform
them or appease them-—that will only make things worse. Do not attack
them, whether directly or indirectly, for they are poisonous in nature and

will work underground to destroy you. Do as the Athenians did: Banish
them before it is too late. Separate them from the group before they be-
come the eye of a whirlpool. Do not give them time to stir up anxieties
and sew discontent; do not give them room to move. Let one person suf-
fer so that the rest can live in peace.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II

In 1296 the cardinals of the Catholic Church met in Rome to select a new
pope. They chose Cardinal Gaetani, for he was incomparably shrewd;
such a man would make the Vatican a great power. Taking the name Boni~
face VIII, Gaetani soon proved he deserved the cardinals’ high opinion of
him: He plotted his moves carefully in advance, and stopped at nothing to
get his way. Once in power, Boniface quickly crushed his rivals and uni-
fied the Papal States. The European powers began to fear him, and sent
delegates to negotiate with him. The German King Albrecht of Austria
even yielded some territory to Boniface. All was proceeding according to
the pope’s plan.

One piece did not fall into place, however, and that was Tuscany, the
richest part of Italy. If Boniface could conquer Florence, Tuscany’s most
powerful city, the region would be his. But Florence was a proud republic,
and would be hard to defeat. The pope had to play his cards skillfully.

Florence was divided by two rival factions, the Blacks and the Whites.
The Whites were the merchant families that had recently and quickly
risen to power and wealth; the Blacks were the older money. Because of
their popularity with the people, the Whites retained control of the city, to
the Blacks’ increasing resentment. The feud between the two grew steadily
more bitter.

Here Boniface saw his chance: He would plot to help the Blacks take
over the city, and Florence would be in his pocket. And as he studied the
situation he began to focus on one man, Dante Alighieri, the celebrated
writer, poet, and ardent supporter of the Whites. Dante had always been
interested in politics. He believed passionately in the republic, and often
chastised his fellow citizens for their lack of spine. He also happened to be
the city’s most eloquent public speaker. In 1300, the year Boniface began
plotting to take over Tuscany, Dante’s fellow citizens had voted him in to
Florence’s highest elected position, making him one of the city’s six pri-
ors. During his six-month term in the post, he had stood firmly against the
Blacks and against all of the pope’s attempts to sow disorder.

By 1301, however, Boniface had a new plan: He called in Charles de
Valois, powerful brother of the king of France, to help bring order to Tus»
cany. As Charles marched through northern Italy, and Florence seethed
with anxiety and fear, Dante quickly emerged as the man who could rally

the people, arguing vehemently against appeasement and working desper-
ately to arm the citizens and to organize resistance against the pope and
his puppet French prince. By hook or by crook, Boniface had to neutralize
Dante. And so, even as on the one hand he threatened Florence with
Charles de Valois, on the other he held out the olive branch, the possibil-
ity of negotiations, hoping Dante would take the bait. And indeed the Flov
rentines decided to send a delegation to Rome and try to negotiate a
peace. To head the mission, predictably, they chose Dante.

Some warned the poet that the wily pope was setting up a trap to lure
him away, but Dante went to Rome anyway, arriving as the French army
stood before the gates of Florence. He felt sure that his eloquence and ma»
son would win the pope over and save the city. Yet when the pope met the
poet and the Florentine delegates, he instantly intimidated them, as he did
so many. “Fall on your knees before me!” he bellowed at their first meet-
ing. “Submit to me! I tell you that in all truth I have nothing in my heart
but to promote your peace.” Succumbing to his powerful presence, the
Florentines listened as the pope promised to look after their interests. He
then advised them to return home, leaving one of their members behind
to continue the talks. Boniface signaled that the man to stay was to be
Dante. He spoke with the utmost politeness, but in essence it was an order.
And so Dante remained in Rome. And while he and the pope contin-
ued their dialogue, Florence fell apart. With no one to rally the Whites,
and with Charles de Valois using the pope’s money to bribe and sow dis-
sension, the Whites disintegrated, some arguing for negotiations, others
switching sides. Facing an enemy now divided and unsure of itself, the
Blacks easily destroyed them within weeks, exacting violent revenge on
them. And once the Blacks stood firmly in power, the pope finally dis-
missed Dante from Rome.

The Blacks ordered Dante to return home to face accusations and

the Blacks condemned him to be
stand trial. When the poet refused,
burned to death if he ever set foot in Florence again. And so Dante began
a miserable life of exile, wandering through Italy, disgraced in the city that
he loved, never to return to Florence, even after his death.

Interpretation
Boniface knew that if he only had a. pretext to lure Dante away, Florence
would crumble. He played the oldest card in the book—threatenix1g with
one hand while holding out the olive branch with the other»~—-and Dante
fell for it. Once the poet was in Rome, the pope kept him there for as long
as it took. For Boniface understood one of the principal precepts in the
game of power: One resolute person, one clisobedient spirit, can tum a
flock of sheep into a den of lions. So be isolated the troublemaker. With-
out the backbone of the city to keep them together, the sheep quickly
scattered.

ters——t.he person with willpower, or smarts, or, most important of all,
charisma. Whatever it costs you, lure this person away, for once he is ab-
sent his powers will lose their effect. His isolation can be physical (banish-
ment or absence from the court), political (narrowing his base of support),
or psychological (alienating him from the group through slander and in-
sinuatiun). Cancer begins with a single cell; excise it before it spreads be-
yond cure.

KEYS TO POWER
In the past, an entire nation would be ruled by a king and his handful of
ministers. Only the elite had any power to play with. Over the centuries,
power has gradually become more and more diffused and democratized.
This has created, however, a common misperception that groups no
longer have centers of power——-that power is spread out and scattered
among many people. Actually, however, power has changed in its num-
bers but not in its essence. There may be fewer mighty tyrants command
ing the power of life and death over millions, but there remain thousands
of petty tyrants ruling smaller realms, and enforcing their will through in-
direct power games, charisma, and so on. In every group, power is con-
centrated in the hands of one or two people, for this is one area in which
human nature will never change: People will congregate around a single
strong personality like planets orbiting a sun.

To labor under the illusion that this kind of power center no longer
exists is to make endless mistakes, waste energy and time, and never hit
the target. Powerful people never waste time. Outwardly they may play
along with the game-—pretending that power is shared among manymbut
inwardly they keep their eyes on the inevitable few in the group who hold
the cards. These are the ones they work on, When troubles arise, they
look for the underlying cause, the single strong character who started the
stirring and whose isolation or banishment will settle the waters again.

In his fami1y~therapy practice, Dr. Milton H. Erickson found that if
the family dynamic was unsettled and dysfunctional there was inevitably
one person who was the stirrer, the troublemaker. In his sessions he would
symbolically isolate this rotten apple by seating him or her apart from the
others, if only by a few feet. Slowly the other family members would see
the physically separate person as the source of their difficulty. Once you
recognize who the stirrer is, pointing it out to other people will accomplish
a great deal. Understanding who controls the group dynamic is a critical
realization. Remember: Stirrers thrive by hiding in the group, disguising
their actions among the reactions of others. Render their actions visible
and they lose their power to upset.

A key element in games of strategy is isolating the enemy’s power. In
chess you try to comer the king. In the Chinese game of go you try to iso~
late the enemy’s forces in small pockets, rendering them immobile and in-
effectual. It is often better to isolate your enemies than to destroy

LAW 42

363

them——you seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in the
game of power, isolation spells death.

The most effective form of isolation is somehow to separate your vic-
tims from their power base. When Mao Tse—tung wanted to eliminate an
enemy in the ruling elite, he did not confront the person directly; be
silently and stealthily worked to isolate the man, divide his allies and turn
them away from him, shrink his support. Soon the man would vanish on
his own.

Presence and appearance have great import in the game of power. To
seduce, particularly in the beginning stages, you need to be constantly
present, or create the feeling that you are; if you are often out of sight, the
charm will wear oil”. Queen Ellzabeth’s prime minister, Robert Cecil,
had two main rivals: the queen’s favorite, the Earl of Essex, and her for-
mer favorite, Sir Walter Raleigh. He contrived to send them both on a
mission against Spain; with them away from the court he managed to
wrap his tentacles around the queen, secure his position as her top ad~
viser and weaken her affection for Raleigh and the earl. The lesson here
is twofold: First, your absence from the court spells danger for you, and
you should never leave the scene in a time of turmoil, for your absence
can both symbolize and induce a loss of power; second, and on the other
hand, luring your enemies away from the court at critical moments is a
great ploy.

Isolation has other strategic uses. When trying to seduce people, it is
often wise to isolate them from their usual social context. Once isolated
they are vulnerable to you, and your presence becomes magnified. Simi-
larly, con artists often look for ways to isolate their marks from their nor
mal social milieux, steering them into new environments in which they
are no longer comfortable. Here they feel weak, and succumb to decep~
tion more easily. Isolation, then, can prove a powerful way of bringing
people under your spell to seduce or swindle them.

You will often find powerful people who have alienated themselves
from the group. Perhaps their power has gone to their heads, and they
consider themselves superior; perhaps they have lost the knack of com-
municating with ordinary folk. Remember: This makes them vulnerable.
Powerful though they be, people like this can be turned to use.

The monk Rasputin gained his power over Czar Nicholas and Czar-
ina Alexandra of Russia through their tremendous isolation from the peo-
ple. Alexandra in particular was a foreigner, and especially alienated
from everyday Russians; Rasputin used his peasant origins to insinuate
himself into her good graces, for she desperately wanted to communicate
with her subjects. Once in the court’s inner circle, Rasputin made himself
indispensable and attained great power. Heading straight for the center,
he aimed for the one figure in Russia who commanded power (the czarina
dominated her husband), and found he had no need to isolate her for the
work was already done. The Rasputin strategy can bring you great power:
Always search out people who hold high positions yet who find them-

selves isolated on the board‘ They are like apples falling into your lap,
easily seduced, and able to catapult you into power yourself.

Finally, the reason you strike at the shepherd is because such an ac-
tion will djshearten the sheep beyond any rational measure. When Het-
nando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro led their tiny forces against the Aztec
and Incan empires, they did not make the mistake of fighting on several
fronts, nor were they intimidated by the numbers arrayed against them;
they captured the kings, Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Vast empires fell
into their hands. With the leader gone the center of gravity is gone; there
is nothing to revolve around and everything falls apart. Aim at the lead-
ers, bring them down, and look for the endless opportunities in the confu-
sion that will ensue.

other words, apply it from a position of superiority, so that you have noth-
ing to fear from his resentment.

Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln’s successor as U.S. president,
saw Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his government. So he
isolated Grant, as a prelude to forcing him out. This only enraged the
great general, however, who responded by forming a support base in the
Republican party and going on to become the next president. It would
have been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where he could
do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may often find it
better to keep people on your side, where you can watch them, than to
risk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them close, you can secretly whit-
tle away at their support base, so that when the time comes to cut them
loose they will fall fast and hard without knowing what hit them.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Near the end of the reign of Louis XV, all of France seemed desperate for
change. When the king’s grandson and chosen successor, the future Louis
XVI, married the fifteen-year-old daughter of the empress of Austria, the
French caught a glimpse of the future that seemed hopeful. The young
bride, Ma.rie~Antoinette, was beautiful and full of life. She instantly
changed the mood of the court, which was rank with Louis XV’s dc»
baucheries; even the common people, who had yet to see her, talked excit-
edly of Marie-Antoinette. The French had grown disgusted with the series
of mistresses who had dominated Louis XV, and they looked forward to
sewing their new queen. In 1773, when Marie-Antoinette publicly rode
through the streets of Paris for the first time, applauding crowds swarmed
around her carriage. “How fortunate,” she wrote her mother, “to be in a
position in which one can gain widespread affection at so little cost.”

In 1774 Louis XV died and Louis XVI took the throne. As soon as
Maxie-Antninette became queen she abandoned herself to the pleasures
she loved the most—-ordering and wearing the most expensive gowns and
jewelry in the realm; sporting the most elaborate hair in history, her
sculpted coiffures rising as much as three feet above her head; and throwing
a constant succession of masked balls and fétes. All of these whims she paid
for on credit, never concerning herself with the cost or who paid the bills.

Marie~Antoinette’s greatest pleasure was the creation and designing of
a private Garden of Eden at the Petit Trianon, a chéteau on the grounds of
Versailles with its own woods. The gardens at the Petit Trianon were to be
as “natural” as possible, including moss applied by hand to the trees and
rocks. To heighten the pastoral effect, the queen employed peasant milk-
maids to milk the finestlooking cows in the realm; launderers and cheese
makers in special peasant outfits she helped design; shepherds to tend
sheep with silk ribbons around their necks. \&#x27;Vhen she inspected the bams,
she would watch her milkmaids squeezing milk into porcelain vases made
at the royal ceramic works. To pass the time, Ma.rie«Antoinette would
gather flowers in the woods around the Petit Trianon, or watch her “good
peasants” doing their “chores.” The place became a separate world, its
community limited to her chosen favofites.

With each new whim, the cost of maintaining the Petit Trianon soared.
Meanwhile. France itself was deteriorating: There was famine and wide
spread discontent. Even socially insulated courtiers seethed with resent-
ment-—the queen treated them like children. Only her favorites mattered,
and these were becoming fewer and fewer. But Marie~Antoinette did not
concern herself with this. Not once throughout her reign did she read a
minister’s report. Not once did she tour the provinces and rally the people
to her side. Not once did she mingle among the Parisians, or receive a dc}
egation from them. She did none of these things because as queen she felt
the people owed her their affection, and she was not required to love them
in return.

In 1784 the queen became embroiled in a scandal. As part of an elabo-
rate swindle, the most expensive diamond necklace in Europe had been

trial her lavish
lifestyle became public: People heard about the money she spent on jewels
and dresses and masked dances. They gave her the nickname “Madame
Deficit,” and from then on she became the focus of the people‘s growing
resentment. When she appeared in her box at the opera the audience
greeted her with hisses. Even the court turned against her. For while she
had been running up her huge ezcpenditures, the country was headed for

rum.

Five years later, in 1789, an unprecedented event took place: the be
ginning of the French Revolution. The queen did not worry—-let the peo-
ple have their little rebellion, she seemed to think; it would soon quiet
down and she would be able to resume her life of pleasure. That year the
people marched on Versailles, forcing the royal family to quit the palace
and take residence in Paris. This was a triumph for the rebels, but it offered
the queen an opportunity to heal the wounds she had opened and establish
contact with the people. The queen, however, had not learned her lesson:
Not once would she leave the palace during her stay in Paris. Her subjects
could rot in hell for all she cared.

In 1792 the royal couple was moved from the palace to a prison, as the
revolution officially declared the end of the monarchy. The following year
Louis XVI was tried, found guilty, and guillotined. As Marie~Autoinette
awaited the same fate, hardly a soul came to her defense-—not one of her
former friends in the court, not one of Europe’s other monarchs (who, as
members of their own countries’ royal families, had all the reason in the
world to show that revolution did not pay), not even her own family in
Austria, including her brother, who now sat on the throne. She had be
come the world’s pariah. In October of 1793, she finally knelt at the guillo-
tine, unrepentant and defiant to the bitter end.

Interpretation
From early on, Marie—Antoinette acquired the most dangerous of attitudes:
As a. young princess in Austria she was endlessly flattered and cajoled. As
the future queen of the French court she was the center of everyone’s atten-
tion. She never learned to charm or please other people, to become at-
tuned to their individual psychologies. She never had to work to get her
way, to use calculafion or cunning or the arts of persuasion. And like every-
one who is indulged from an early age, she evolved into a monster of in-
sensitivity.

Marie-Antoinette became the focus of an entire country’s dissatisfac-
tion because it is so infuriating to meet with a person who makes no effort
to seduce you or attempt to persuade you, even if only for the purpose of
deception. And do not imagine that she represents a bygone era, or that
she is even rare. Her type is today more common than ever. Such types live
in their own bubble—they seem to feel they are born kings and queens,
and that attention is owed them. They do not consider anyone else’: na-
ture, but bulldoze over people with the selfirighteous arrogance of a Marie-
Antoinette. Pampered and mdulged as children, as adults they still believe

that everything must come to them; convinced of their own charm, they
make no effort to charm, seduce, or gently persuade.

In the realm of power, such attitudes are disastrous. At all times you
must attend to those around you, gauging their particular psychology, tai—
loxing your words to what you know will entice and seduce them. This re
quires energy and art. The higher your station, the greater the need to
remain attuned to the hearts and minds of those below you, creating a base
of support to maintain you at the pinnacle. Without that base, your power
will teeter, and at the slightest change of fortune those below will gladly as-

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
in A.D. 225, Chuko Liang, master strategist and chief minister to the ruler
of Shu in ancient China, confronted a dangerous situation. The kingdom of
Wei had mounted an all~out attack on Shu from the north. More dangerous
still, Wei had formed an alliance with the barbarous states to the south of
Shu, led by King Menghuo. Chuko Liang had to deal with this second
menace from the south before he could hope to fend off Wei in the north.

As Chuko Liang prepared to march south against the barbarians, a
wise man in his camp offered him advice. It would be impossible, this man
said, to pacify the region by force. Lizmg would probably beat Menghuo,
but as soon as he headed north again to deal with Wei, Menghuo would
reinvade. “It is better to win hearts,&quot; said the wise man, “than cities; better
to battle with hearts than with weapons. I hope you will succeed in winning
the hearts of these people.” “You read my thoughts,” responded Chuko
Liang.

As Liang expected, Menghuo launched a. powerful atm But Liang
laid a trap and managed to capture a large part of Menghuds army, includ-
ing the king himself. Instead of punishing or executing his prisoners, how-
ever, he separated the soldiers from their king, had their shackles removed,
regaled them with food and wine, and then addressed them. “You are all
upright men,” he said. “I believe you all have parents, wives, and children
waiting for you at home. They are doubtless shedding bitter tears at your
fate. I am going to release you, so that you can return home to your loved
ones and comfort them.” The men thanked Liang with tears in their eyes;
then he sent for Menghuo. “If 1 release you,” asked Liang, “what will you
do?” “I will pull my army together again,” answered the king, “and lead it
against you to a decisive battle. But if you capture me a second time, I will
bow to your superiority.” Not only did Liang order Menghuo released, he
gave him a gift of a horse and saddle. When angry lieutenants wondered
why he did this, Liang told them, “I can capture that man as easily as I can
take something out of my pocket. I am trying to win his heart. When I do,
peace will come of itself here in the south.”

As Menghuo had said he would, he attacked again. But his own offi-
cers, whom Liang had treated so well, rebelled against him, captured him,
and turned him over to Liang, who asked him again the same question as

before. Menghuo replied that he had not been beaten fairly, but merely be-
trayed by his own officers; he would fight again, but if captured a third time
he would bow to Liang’s superiority.

Over the following months Liang outwitted Menghuo again and again,
capturing him a third, a fourth, and a fifth time. On each occasion Meng—
huo’s troops grew more dissatisfied. Liang had treated them with respect;
they had lost their heart for fighting. But every time Chuko Liang asked
Menghuo to yield, the great king would come up with another excuse: You
tricked me, I lost through bad luck, on and on. If you capture me again,
he would promise, I swear I will not betray you. And so Liang would let
him go.

When he captured Menghuo for the sixth time, he asked the king the
same question again. “If you capture me a seventh time,” the king replied,
“I shall give you my loyalty and never rebel again.” “Very well,” said
Liang. “But if I capture you again, I will not release you.”

Now Menghuo and his soldiers fled to a far corner of their kingdom,
the region of Wuge. Defeated so many times, Menghuo had only one hope
left: He would ask the help of King Wutugu of Wuge, who had an immense
and ferocious army. Wutugu’s warriors wore an armor of tightly woven
vines soaked in oil,
then dried to an impenetrable hardness. With
Menghuo at his side, Wutugu marched this mighty army against Liang, and
this time the great strategist seemed frightened, leading his men in a hur-
ried relreat. But he was merely leading Wutugu into a trap: He cornered
the king’s men in a narrow valley, then lit fires set all around them. When
the fires reached the soldiers Wutugu’s whole army burst into flame-the
oii in their armor, of course, being highly flammable. All of them perished.
Liang had managed to separate Mengliuo and his entourage from the
carnage in the valley, and the king found himself a captive for the seventh
time. After this slaughter Liang could not bear to face his prisoner again.
He sent a messenger to the captured king: “He has commissioned me to re-
lease you. Mobilize another army against him, if you can, and try once
more to defeat him.” Sobbing, the king fell to the ground, crawled to Liang
on his hands and knees, and prostrated himself at his feet. “Oh great minis-
ter,” cried Menghuo, “yours is the majesty of Heaven. We men of the south
will never again olier resistance to your rule.” “Do you now yield?” asked
Liang. “I, my sons, and my grandsons are deeply moved by Your Hon0r’s
boundless, lifegiving mercy. How could we not yield?”

Liang honored Menghuo with a great banquet, reestablished him on
the throne, restored his conquered lands to his rule, then returned north
with his army, leaving no occupying force. Liang never came back—he had
no need to: Menghuo had become his most devoted and unshakable ally.

Interpretation
Chuko Liang had two options: Try to defeat the barbarians in the south
with one crushing blow, or patiently and slowly win them to his side over
time. Most people more powerful than their enemy grab the first option
and never consider the second, but the truly powerful think far ahead: The

first option may be quick and easy, but over time it brews ugly emotions in
the hearts of the vanquished. Their resentment turns to hatred; such ani-
mosity keeps you on edge~—you spend your energy protecting what you
have gained, growing paranoid and defensive. The second option, though
more difficult, not only brings you peace of mind, it converts a potential
enemy info a pillar of support.

In all your encounters, cake a step back—-take the time to calculate and
attune yourself to your targets’ emotional makeup and psychological weak-
nesses. Force will only strengthen their resistance. ‘With most people the
heart is the key: They are like children, ruled by their emotions. To soften
them up, alternate harshness with mercy. Play on their basic fears, and also
their loves——freeclom, family, etc. Once you break them down, you will
have a lifelong friend and fiercely loyal ally.

KEYS TO POWER
In the game of power, you are surrounded by people who have absolutely
no reason to help you unless it is in their interest to do so. And if you have
nothing to offer their selfiinterest, you are likely to make them hostile, for
they will see in you just one more competitor, one more waster of their
time. Those that overcome this prevailing coldness are the ones who find
the key that unlocks the stra.nger’s head and mind, seducing him into their
corner, if necessary sofiening him up for a punch. But most people never
learn this side of the game. Vlrhen they meet someone new, rather than
stepping back and probing to see what makes this person unique, they talk
about themselves, eager to impose their own willpower and prejudices.
They argue, boast, and make a show of their power. They may not know it
but they are secretly creating an enemy, a resistor, because there is no
more infuriating feeling than having your individuality ignored, your own
psychology unacknowledged. It makes you feel lifeless and resentful.

Remember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and break-
ing them down, gently. Seduce them with a two—pronged approach: Work
on their emotions and play on their intellectual weaknesses. Be alert to
both what separates them from everyone else (their individual psychology)
and what they share with everyone else (their basic emotional responses).
Aim at the primary emotions——love, hate, jealousy. Once you move their
emotions you have reduced their control, making them more vulnerable to
persuasion.

When Chuko Liang wanted to dissuade an important general of a rival
kingdom from entering into an alliance with Ts’ao Ts’ao, Liang’s dreaded
enemy, he did not detail &quot;rm; Ts’ao’s cruelty, or attack him on moral
grounds. Instead Liang suggested that Ts’ao Ts’ao was really after the gen»

terms. Educated and well—rea.d himself,

eral’s beautiful young wife. This hit the general in the gut, and won him
over. Mao Tse—tung similarly always appealed to popular emotions, and
in his
spoke in the simplest
speeches he used visceral metaphors, voicing the public’s deepest amdelies
and encouraging them to vent their frustrations in public meetings. Rather
than arguing the practical aspects of a. particular program, he would de~
scribe how it would affect them on the most primitive, down—to—earth level.
Do not believe that this approach works only with the illiterate and un-
sch0oled—it works on one and all. All of us are mortal and face the same
dreadful fate, and all of us share the desire for attachment and belonging.
Stir up these emotions and you captivate our hearts.

The best way to do this is with a dramatic jolt, of the kind that Chuko
Liang created when be fed and released prisoners who expected only the
worst from him. Shaking them to the core, he softened their hearts. Play on
contrasts like this: Push people to despair, then give them relief. If they ex~
pect pain and you give them pleasure, you win their hearts. Creating plea-
sure of any kind, in fact, will usually bring you success, as will allaying fears
and providing or promising security.

Symbolic gestures are often enough to win sympathy and goodwill. A
for example--a show that you suffer as those
gesture of self—sacri.fice,
around you do—will make people identify with you, even if your suffering
is symbolic or minor and theirs is real. When you enter a group, make a
gesture of goodwill; soften the group up for the harsher actions that will fol-
low later.

When T. E. Lawrence was fighting the Turks in the deserts of the Mid-
dle East during World War I, he had an epiphany: It seemed to him that
Conventional warfare had lost its value. The old-fashioned soldier was lost
in the enormous amiies of the time, in which he was ordered about like a
lifeless pawn. Lawrence wanted to turn this around. For him, every sol-
dier’s mind was a kingdom he had to conquer. A committed, psychologi-
cally motivated soldier would fight harder and more creatively than a.
puppet.

Lawrence’s perception is still more true in the world today, where so
many of us feel alienated, anonymous, and suspicious of authority, all of
which makes overt power plays and force even more counterproductive
and dangerous. Instead of manipulating lifeless pawns, make those on your
side convinced and excited by the cause you have enlisted them in; this
will not only make your work easier but it will also give you more leeway
to deceive them later on. And to accomplish this you need to deal with
their individual psychologies. Never clumsily assume that the tactic that
worked on one person will necessarily work on another. To find the key
that will motivate them, first get them to open up. The more they talk, the
more they reveal about their likes and dislikes--the handles and levers to
move them with.

The quickest way to secure people’s minds is by demonstrating, as
simply as possible, how an action will benefit them. Self—interest is the

LAW 43

‘

3&#x27;73

strongest motive of all: A great cause may capture minds, but once the firs:
flush of excitement is over, interest will flag--unless there is something to
be gained. Self-interest is the solider foundation. The causes that work best
use a noble veneer to cover a blatant appeal to self-interest; the cause se-
duces but the self-interest secures the deal.

The people who are best at appealing to people’s minds are often
artists, intellectuals, and those of a more poetic nature. This is because
ideas are most easily communicated through metaphors and imagery. It is
always good policy, then, to have in your pocket at least one artist or intel~
lectual who can appeal concretely to people’s minds. Kings have always
kept a stable of writers in their ham: Frederick the Great had his Voltaire
(until they quaneled and separated), Napoleon won over Goethe. Con-
versely, Napoleon III’s alienation of writers such as Victor Hugo, whom he
exiled from France, contributed to his growing unpopularity and eventual
downfall. It is dangerous, then, to alienate those who have powers of ex»
pression, and useful to pacify and exploit them.

Finally, learn to play the numbers game‘ The wider your support base
the stronger your power. Understanding that one alienated, disaffected
soul can spark a blaze of discontent, Louis XIV made sure to endear him-
self to the lowest members of his staff. You too must constantly win over
more allies on all levels-we time will inevitably come when you will need
them.

MIRROR EFFECTS: Preliminary Typology
Mirrors have the power to disturb us. Gazing at our reflection in the mir~
rot, we most often see what we want to see—the image of ourselves with
which we are most comfortable. We tend not to look too closely, ignoring
the wrinkles and blemishes. But if we do look hard at the reflected image,
we sometimes feel that we are seeing ourselves as others see us, as a person
among other people, an object rather than a subject. That feeling makes us
shudder—we see ourselves, but from the outside, minus the thoughts,
spirit, and soul that fill our consciousness. We are a thing.

In using Mirror Efiects we symbolically re—create this disturbing power
by mirroring the actions of other people, mimicking their movements to
unsettle and infuriate them. Made to feel mocked, cloned, objectlike, an
image without a soul, they get angry. Or do the same thing slightly differ’
ently and they might feel disarmed—you have perfectly reflected their
wishes and desires. This is the narcissism: power of mirrors. In either case,
the Mirror Efiect unsettles your targets, whether angering or entrancing
them, and in that instant you have the power to manipulate or seduce
them. The Effect contains great power because it operates on the most
primitive emotions.

There are four main Mirror Effects in the realm of power:

The Neutralizing Eflect. In ancient Greek mythology,
the Gorgon
Medusa had serpents for hair, protruding tongue, massive teeth, and a face
so ugly that anyone who gazed at her was turned into stone, out of fright.
But the hero Perseus managed to slay Medusa by polishing his bronze
shield into a mirror, then using the reflection in the mirror to guide him as
he crept up and cut off her head without looking at her directly. If the
shield in this instance was a mirror, the mirror also was a kind of shield:
Medusa could not see Perseus, she saw only her own reflected actions, and
behind this screen the hero stole up and destroyed her.

This is the essence of the Neutralizing Eifect: Do what your enemies
do, following their actions as best you can, and they cannot see what you
are up to—they are blinded by your mirror. Their strategy for dealing with
you depends on your reacting to them in a way characteristic of you; new
tralize it by playing a game of mimicry with them. The tactic has a mock—
ing, even infuriating effect. Most of us remember the childhood experience
of someone teasing us by repeating our words exactly-—after a while, usu-
ally not long, we wanted to punch them in the face. Working more subtly
as an adult, you can still unsettle your opponents this way; shielding your
own strategy with the mirror, you lay invisible traps, or push your oppo-
nents into the trap they planned for you.

This powerful technique has been used in military strategy since the
days of Sun-tzu; in our own time it often appears in political campaigning.
It is also useful for disguising those situations in which you have no particu-
lar strategy yourself. This is the Wa.rn‘or’s Mirror.

A reverse version of the Neutralizing Effect

shadow your opponents’ every move without their seeing you. Use the
Shadow to gather information that will neutralize their strategy later on,
when you will be able to thwart their every move. The Shadow is effective
because to follow the movements of others is to gain valuable insights into
their habits and routines. The Shadow is the preeminent device for detec-
tives and spies.

The Narcissus Eflect. Gazing at an image in the waters of a pond, the
Greek youth Narcissus fell in love with it. And when he found out that the
image was his own reflection, and that he therefore could not consummate
his love, he despaired and drowned himself. All of us have a similar prob-
lem: We are profoundly in love with ourselves, but since this love excludes
a love object outside ourselves, it remains continuously unsatisfied and un-
fulfilled. The Narcissus Effect plays on this universal narcissism: You look
deep into the souls of other people; fathom their inmost desires, their val-
ues, their tastes, their spirit; and you reflect it back to them, making your-
self into a kind of mirror image. Your ability to reflect their psyche gives
you great power over them; they may even feel a tinge of love.

This is simply the ability to mimic another person not physically, but
psychologically, and it is immensely powerful because it plays upon the
unsatisfied se1f—love of a child. Normally, people bombard us with their ex-
their tastes. They hardly ever make the effort to see things
periences,
through our eyes. This is annoying, but it also creates great opportunity: If
you can show you understand another person by reflecting their inmost
feelings, they will be entranced and disarmed, all the more so because it
happens so rarely. No one can resist this feeling of being harmoniously re-
flected in the outside world, even though you might well be manufacturing
it for their benefit, and for deceptive purposes of your own.

The Narcissus Effect works wonders in both social life and business; it

gives us both the Seducer’s and the Coum&#x27;er’s Mirror.

The Moral Effect. The power of verbal argument is extremely limited,
and often accomplishes the opposite of what is intended. As Gracién re-
marks, “The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.” The Moral Effect is a
perfect way to demonstrate your ideas through action. Quite simply, you
teach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their own medicine.

In the Moral Effect, you mirror what other people have done to you,
and do so in a way that makes them realize you are doing to them exactly
what they did to you. You make them feel that their behavior has been un-
pleasant, as opposed to hearing you complain and whine about it, which
only gets their defenses up. And as they feel the result of their actions mir~
rored back at them, they realize in the profoundest sense how they hurt or
punish others with their unsocial behavior. You objectify the qualifies you
want them to feel ashamed of and create a mirror in which they can gaze at
their follies and learn a lesson about themselves. This technique is often
used by educators, psychologists, and anyone who has to deal with un-

pleasant and unconscious behavior. This is the Teacher’s Mirror. Vifhether
or not there is actually anything wrong with the way people have treated
you, however, it can often be to your advantage to reflect it back to them in
a way that makes them feel guilty about it.

The Hallucinatory Effect. Mirrors are tremendously deceptive, for they
create a sense that you are looking at the real world. Actually, though, you
are only staring at a piece of glass, which, as everyone knows, cannot show
the world exactly as it is: Everything in a mirror is reversed. When Alice
goes through the looking glass in Lewis Ca.rroll’s book, she enters a world
that is back~to—front, and more than just visually.

The Hallucinatory Effect comes from creating a perfect copy of an ob-
ject, a place, a person. This copy acts as a kind of dummy—-people take it
for the real thing, because it has the physical appearance of the real thing.
This is the preeminent technique of con artists, who strategically mimic the
real world to deceive you. It also has applications in any arena that re
quires camouflage. This is the Deceiver’s Mirror.

OBSERVANCES OF MIRROR EFFECTS

Observance I
In February of 1815, the emperor Napoleon escaped from the island of
Elba, where he had been imprisoned by the allied forces of Europe, and re-
turned to Paris in a match that stirred the French nation, rallying troops
and citizens of all classes to his side and chasing his successor, King Louis
XVIII, off the throne‘ By March, however, having reestablished himselfin
power, he had to face the fact that France’s situation had gravely changed.
The country was devastated, he had no allies among the other European
nations, and his most loyal and important ministers had deserted him or
left the country. Only one man remained from the old regin-ie—joseph
Fouché, his former minister of police.

Napoleon had relied on Fouché to do his dirty work throughout his
previous reign, but he had never been able to figure his minister out. He
kept a corps of agents to spy on all of his ministers, so that he would always
have an edge on them, but no one had gotten anything on Fouché. If sus~
pected of some miscleed, the minister would not get angry or take the accu-
sation personally—he would submit, nod, smile, and change colors
chameleonlike, adapting to the requirements of the moment. At first this
had seemed somewhat pleasant and charming, but after a while it frus-
trated Napoleon, who felt outdone by this slippery man. At one time or an
other he had fired all of his most important ministers, including Talleyrand,
but he never touched Fouché. And so, in 1815, back in power and in need
of help, he felt he had no choice but to reappoint Fouché as his minister of
police.

Several weeks into his new reign, Napoleorfs spies told him they be-

lieved Fouché was in secret contact with ministers of foreign countries, in-
cluding Metvernich of Austria. Afraid that his most valuable minister was
betraying him to his enemies, Napoleon had to find out the truth before it
was too late, He could not confront Fouché directly—in person the man
was as slippery as an eel. He needed hard proof.

This seemed to come in April, when the emperor’s private police cap
tured a Viennese gentleman who had come to Paris to pass infonnation on
to Fouché. Ordering the man brought before him, Napoleon threatened to
shoot him then and there unless he confessed; the man broke down and
admitted he had given Fouché a letter from Metternich, written in invisible
ink, arranging for a secret meeting of special agents in Basel. Napoleon ars-
cordingly ordered one of his own agents to infiltrate this meeting. If Fouché
was indeed planning to betray him, he would finally be caught red-handed
and would hang.

Napoleon waited impatiently for the agent’s return, but to his bewil-
derment the agent showed up days later reporting that he had heard noth-
ing that would implicate Fouché in a conspiracy. In fact it seemed that the
other agents present suspected Fouché of double-crossing them, as if he
were working for Napoleon all along. Napoleon did not believe this for an
instant—Fouché had somehow outwitted him again.

.

The following morning Fouché visited Napoleon, and remarked, “By
the way, sire, I never told you that I had a letter from Metternich a few
days ago; my mind was so full of things of greater moment. Besides, his
emissary omitted to give me the powder needed to make the writing legi-
. Here at length is the letter.” Sure that Fouché was toying with him,
ble. .
Napoleon exploded, “You are a traitor, Fouché! I ought to have you
hanged.” He continued to harangue Fouché, but could not fire him without
proof. Fouché only expressed amazement at the emperor’s words, but in-
wardly he smiled, for all along he had been playing a mirroring game.
Interpretation
Fouché had known for years that Napoleon kept on top of those around
him by spying on them day and night. The minister had survived this game
by having his own spies spy on Napoleon’s spies, thus neutralizing any ac-
tion Napoleon might take against him. In the case of the meeting in Basel,
he even turned the tables: Knowing about Napoleorfs double agent, he set
it up so that it would appear as if Fouché were a loyal double agent too.

Fouché gained power and flourished in a period of great tumult by
mirroring those around him. Duning the French Revolution he was a radi-
cal jacobin; after the Terror he became a moderate republican; and under
Napoleon he became a committed imperialist whom Napoleon ennobled
and made the duke of Otranto. If Napoleon took up the weapon of digging
up dirt on people, Fouché made sure he had the dirt on Napoleon, as well
as on everyone else. This also allowed him to predict the emperor’s plans
and desires, so that he could echo his boss’s sentiments before he had even
uttered them. Shielding his actions with a mirror strategy, Fouché could
also plot offensive moves without being caught in the act.

This is the power of mirroring those around you. First, you give people

the feeling that you share their thoughts and goals. Second, if they suspect
you have ulterior motives, the mirror shields you from them, preventing
them from figuring out your strategy. Eventually this will infuriate and un-
settle them. By playing the double, you steal their thunder, suck away their
initiative, make them feel helpless. You also gain the ability to choose when
and how to unsettle them—anot.her avenue to power. And the mirror saves
you mental energy: simply echoing the moves of others gives you the
space you need to develop a strategy of your own.

Observance II
Early on in his career, the ambitious statesman and general Alcibiades of
Athens (450—404 8.0) fashioned a formidable weapon that became the
source of his power. In every encounter with others, he would sense their
moods and tastes, then carefully tailor his words and actions to mirror their
inmost desires. He would seduce them with the idea that their values were
superior to everyone else’s, and that his goal was to model himself on them
or help them realize their dreams. Few could resist his charm.

The first man to fall under his spell was the philosopher Socrates. Al-
cibiades represented the opposite of the Socratic ideal of simplicity and up-
rightness: He lived lavishly and was completely unprincipled. Whenever
he met Socrates, however, he mirrored the older man’s sobriety, eating
simply, accompanying Socrates on long walks, and talking only of philoso-
phy and virtue. Socrates was not completely fooled——he was not unaware
of Alcibiades’ other life. But that only made him vulnerable to a logic that
flattered him: Only in my presence, he felt, does this man submit to a. virtu-
ous influence; only I have such power over him. This feeling intoxicated
Socrates, who became Alcibiades’ fervent admirer and supporter, one day
even risking his own life to rescue the young man in battle.

The Athenians considered Alcibiades their greatest orator, for he had
an uncanny ability to tune in to his audience’s aspirations, and mirror their
desires. He made his greatest speeches in support of the invasion of Sicily,
which he thought would bring great wealth to Athens and limitless glory to
himself. The speeches gave expression to young Athenians’ thirst to com
quer lands for themselves, rather than living off the victories of their a.nces~
tors. But he also tailored his words to reflect older men&#x27;s nostalgia for the
glory years when Athens led the Greeks against Persia, and then went on to
create an empire. All Athens now dreamed of conquering Sicily; Alcibi-
ades’ plan was approved, and he was made the expedition’s commander.

While Alcibiades was leading the invasion of Sicily, however, certain
Athenians fabricated charges against him of profaning sacred statues. He
knew his enemies would have him executed if he returned home, so at the
last minute he deserted the Athenian fleet and defected to Athens’s bitter
enemy, Sparta. The Spartans welcomed this great man to their side, but
they knew his reputation and were wary of him. Alcibiades loved luxury;
the Spartans were a warrior people who worshipped austerity, and they
were afraid he would corrupt their youth. But much to their relief, the Al~

cibiacles who arrived in Sparta was not at all what they expected: He wore
his hair untfimmed (as they did), took cold baths, ate coarse bread and
black broth, and wore simple clothes. To the Spartans this signified that he
had come to see their way of life as superior to the Athenian; greater than
they were, he had chosen to be a Spartan rather than being born one, and
should thus be honored above all others. They fell under his spell and
gave him great powers. Unfortunately Alcibiades rarely knew how to
rein in his cha.rm—he managed to seduce the king of Spaxtafs wife and
make her pregnant. When this became public he once more had to flee
for his life.

This time Alcibiades defected to Persia, where he suddenly went from
Spartan simplicity to embracing the lavish Persian lifestyle down to the last
detail. It was of course immensely flattering to the Persians to see a Greek
of Alcibiades’ stature prefer their culture over his own, and they showered
him with honors, land, and power. Once seduced by the mirror, they failed
to notice that behind this shield Alcibiades was playing a double game, se-
cretly helping the Athenians in their war with Sparta and thus reingrafiab
ing himself with the city to which he desperately wanted to remm, and
which welcomed him back with open arms in 408 B.C.
Interpretation
Early in his political career, Alcibiades made a discovery that changed his
whole approach to power: He had a colorful and forceful personality, but
when he argued his ideas strongly with other people he would win over a
few while at the same time alienating many more. The secret to gaining as»
cendancy over large numbers, he came to believe, was not to impose his
colors but to absorb the colors of those around him, like a chameleon.
Once people fell for the trick, the decepfions he went on to practice would
be invisible to them.

Understand: Everyone is wrapped up in their own narcissistic shell.
When you try to impose your own ego on them, a wall goes up, resistance
is increased. By mirroring them, however, you seduce them into a kind of
narcissistic rapture: They are gazing at a double of their own soul. This
double is actually manufactured in its entirety by you. Once you have used
the mirror to seduce them, you have great power over them.

It is worth noting, however, the dangers in the promiscuous use of the
mirror. In Alcibiades’ presence people felt larger, as if their egos had been
doubled. But once he left, they felt empty and diminished, and when they
saw him mirroring completely different people as totally as he had mir-
rored them, they felt not just diminished but betrayed. Alcibiades’ overuse
of the Mirror Effect made whole peoples feel used, so that he constantly
had to flee from one place to another. indeed Alcibiades so angered the
Spartans that they finally had him murdered. He had gone Loo far. The Se-
ducer’s Mirror must be used with caution and discrimination.

most important court functions.

the French prime minister. Of

One daughter, Marie Mancini, did not share this good fortune, for she
lacked the beauty and grace of her sisters——who, along with her mother
and even Cardinal Mazarin, eventually came to dislike her, for they felt
she spoiled the family image. They tried to persuade her to enter a. con-
vent, where she would be less of an embarrassment, but she refused. In-
stead she applied herself
learning Latin and Greek,
to her studies,
perfecting her French, and practicing her musical skills. On the rare occa-
sions when the family would let her attend court affairs, she trained herself
to be an artful listener, sizing people up for their weaknesses and hidden
desires. And when she finally met the future King Louis XIV, in 1657
(Louis was seventeen years old, Marie eighteen), she decided that to spite
her family and uncle, she would find a way to make this young man fall in
love with her.

This was a seemingly impossible task for such a plainloolcing girl, but
Marie studied the future king closely. She noticed that her sisters’ frivolity
did not please him, and she sensed that he loathed the scheming and petty
politicldng that went on all around him. She saw that he had a romantic na-
ture-——he read adventure novels, insisted on marching at the head of his
armies, and had high ideals and a passion for glory. The court did not feed
these fantasies of his; it was a banal, superficial world that bored him.

The key to Louis’s heart, Marie saw, would be to construct a mirror re-
flecting his fantasies and his youthful yeamings for glory and romance. To
begin with she immersed herself in the romantic novels, poems, and plays
that she knew the young ldng read voraciously. When Louis began to en-
gage her in conversation, to his delight she would talk of the things that
stirred his soul——not this fashion or that piece of gossip, but rather courtly
love, the deeds of great knights, the nobility of past kings and heroes. She
led his thirst for glory by creating an image of an august, superior king
whom he could aspire to become. She stirred his imagination.

As the future Sun King spent more and more time in Matie’s presence,
it eventually became clear that he had fallen in love with the least likely
young woman of the court. To the horror of her sisters and mother, he
showered Marie Mancini with attention. He brought her along on his mili-
taiy campaigns, and made a show of stationing her where she could watch
as he marched into battle. He even promised Marie that he would marry
her and make her queen.

Mazarin, however, would never allow the king to many his niece, a
woman who could bring France no diplomatic or royal alliances. Louis had
to marry a princess of Spain or Austria. In 1658 Louis succumbed to the
pressure and agreed to break off the first romantic involvement of his life.
He did so with much regret, and at the end of his life he acknowledged that
he never loved anyone as much as Marie Mancini.

Interpretation
Marie Mancini played the seducer’s game to perfection. First, she took a
step back, to study her prey. Seduction often fails to get past the first step
because it is too aggressive; the first move must always be a retreat. By
studying the king from a distance Marie saw what distinguished him from
others»-—his high ideals, romantic nature, and snobbish disdain for petty
politics. Marie’s next step was to make a mirror for these hidden yearnings
on Louis’s part, letting him glimpse what he himself could be——-a godlike
king!

This mirror had several functions: Satisfying Louis’s ego by giving him
a double to look at, it also focused on him so exclusively as to give him the
feeling that Marie existed for him alone. Surrounded by a pack of schem~
ing courtiers who only had their own self—interest at heart, he could not fail
to be touched by this devotional focus. Finally Marie-’s mirror set up an
ideal for him to live up to: the noble knight of the medieval court. To a soul
both romantic and ambitious, nothing could be more intoxicating than to
have someone hold up an idealized reflection of him. In effect it was Marie
Mancini who created the image of the Sun King——indeed Louis later ad»
mitted the enormous part she had played in fashioning his radiant self»
image.

This is the power of the Seducefs Mirror: By doubling the tastes and
ideals of the target, it shows your attention to his or her psychology, an at-
tention more charming than any aggressive pursuit. Find out what sets the
other person apart, then hold up the mirror that will reflect it and bring it
out of them. Feed their fantasies of power and greatness by reflecting their
ideals, and they will succumb.

Observance IV
In 1538, with the death of his mother, Helena, the eight-year-old future
czar Ivan IV (or Ivan the Terrible) of Russia became an orphan. For the
next five years he watched as the princely class, the boyars, terrorized the
country. Now and then, to mock the young Ivan, they would make him
wear a crown and scepter and place him on the throne. VVhen the little
boy&#x27;s feet dangled over the edge of the chair, they would laugh and lift him
off it, handing him from man to man in the air, making him feel his help
lessness compared to them.

When Ivan was thirteen, he boldly murdered the boyar leader and as-
cended to the throne. For the next few decades he struggled to subdue the
boyars’ power, but they continued to defy him. By 1575 his efforts to trans-
form Russia and defeat its enemies had exhausted him. Meanwhile, his
subjects were complaining bitterly about his endless wars, his secret police,
the unvanquished and oppressive boyars. His own ministers began to ques-
tion his moves. Finally he had had enough. In 1564 he had temporarily
abandoned the throne, forcing his subjects to call him back to power. Now
he took the strategy a step further, and abdicated.

To take his place Ivan elevated a general of his, Simeon Bekbulatovich,

384

LAW 41¢

to the throne. But although Simeon had recently converted to Christianity,
he was by birth a Tartar, and his enthronement was an insult to Ivan’s sub-
jects, since Russians looked down on the Tartars as inferiors and infidels.
Yet Ivan ordered that all Russians, including the boyars, pledge obedience
to their new ruler. And while Simeon moved into the Kremlin, Ivan lived
in a humble house on Moscow’s outskirts, from which he would sometimes
\n‘sit the palace, bow before the throne, sit among the other boyars, and
humbly petition Simeon for favors.

Over time it became clear that Simeon was a kind of kings double. He
dressed like Ivan, and acted like Ivan, but he had no real power, since no
one would really obey him. The boyars at the court who were old enough
to remember taunting Ivan when he was a boy, by placing him on the
throne, saw the connection: They had made Ivan feel like a weak pre-
tender, so now he mirrored them by placing a weak pretender of his own
on the throne.

For two long years Ivan held the mirror of Simeon up to the Russian
people. The mirror said: Your whining and disobedience have made me a
czar with no real power, so I will reflect back to you a czar with no real
power. You have treated me disrespectfully, so I will do the same to you,
making Russia the laughingstock of the world. In 1577, in the name of the
Russian people, the chastised boyars once again begged Ivan to return to
the throne, which he did. He lived as czar until his death, in 1584, and the
conspiracies, complaining, and second—guessing disappeared along with
Simeon.

Interpretation
In 15 64, after threatening to abdicate, Ivan had been granted absolute pow-
ers. But these powers had slowly been chipped away as every sector of so-
ciety—the boyars, the church, the government—vied for more control.
Foreign wars had exhausted the country, internal bickering had increased,
and Ivan’s attempts to respond had been met with scorn. Russia had turned
into a kind of boisterous classroom in which the pupils laughed openly at
the teacher. If he raised his voice or complained, he only met more resis-
tance. He had to teach them a lesson, give them a taste of their own medi-
cine. Simeon Bekbulatovich was the mirror he used to do so.

After two years in which the throne had been an object of ridicule and
disgust, the Russian people learned their lesson. They wanted their czar
back, conceding to him all the dignity and respect that the position should
always have commanded. For the rest of his reign, Russia and Ivan got
along fine.

Understand: People are locked in their own experiences. When you
whine about some insensitivity on their part, they may seem to understand,
but inwardly they are untouched and even more resistant. The goal of
power is always to lower people’s resistance to you. For this you need
tricks, and one trick is to teach them a lesson.

Instead of haranguing people verbally, then, create a kind of mirror of
their behavior, In doing so you leave them two choices: They can ignore

LAW 44

you, or they can start to think about themselves. And even if they ignore
you, you will have planted a seed in their unconscious that will eventually
take root. When you mirror their behavior, incidentally, do not be afraid to
add a touch of caricature and exaggeration, as Ivan did by enthroning a
TaItar—it is the little spice in the soup that will open their eyes and make
them see the ridiculousness in their own actions.

Observance V
Dr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer in strategic psychotherapy, would often
educate his patients powerfully but indirectly by creating a kind of mirror
effect. Constructing an analogy to make patients see the truth on their own,
he would bypass their resistance to change. When Dr. Erickson treated
married couples complaining of sexual problems, for instance, he often
found that psychotherapy’s tradition of direct confrontation and problem-
airing only heightened the spouses’ resistance and sharpened their differ-
ences. Instead, he would draw a husband and wife out on other topics,
often banal ones, trying to find an analogy for the sexual conflict.

In one couple’s first session,

the pair were discussing their eating
habits, especially at dinner. The wife preferred the leisurely approach——a
drink before the meal, some appetizers, and then a small main course, all at
a slow, civilized pace. This frustrated the husband-—he wanted to get din-
ner over quickly and to dig right into the main course, the bigger the better.
As the conversation continued, the couple began to catch glimpses of an
analogy to their problems in bed. The moment they made this connection,
however, Dr. Erickson would change the subject, carefully avoiding a dis-
cussion of the real problem.

The couple thought Erickson was just getting to know them and would
deal with the problem directly the next time he saw them. But at the end of
this first session, Dr. Erickson directed them to arrange a dinner a few
nights away that would combine each person’s desire: The wife would get
the slow meal, including time spent bonding, and the husband would get
the big dishes he wanted to eat. Without realizing they were acting under
the doctor’s gentle guidance, the couple would walk into a mirror of their
problem, and in the mirror they would solve their problems themselves,
ending the evening just as the doctor had h0ped—by mirroring the im-
proved dinner dynamics in bed.

In dealing with more severe problems, such as the schizophrenids
mirror fantasy world of his or her own construction, Dr. Erickson would al-
ways try to enter the mirror and work within it, He once treated a hospital
inmate who believed he was Jesus Christ-—draping sheets around his
body, talking in vague parables, and bombarding staff and patients with
endless Christian proselytizing. No therapy or drugs seemed to work, until
one day Dr. Erickson went up to the young man and said, “I understand
you have had experience as a carpenter.” Being Christ, the patient had to
say that he had had such experience, and Erickson immediately put him to
work building bookcases and other useful items, allowing him to wear his
Jesus garb. Over the next weeks, as the patient worked on these projects,

386

LAW 44

his mind became less occupied with Jesus fantasies and more focused on
his labor. As the carpentry work took precedence, a psychic shift took ef-
fect: The religious fantasies remained, but faded comfortably into the back-
ground, allowing the man to fimction in society.
Interpretation
Communication depends on metaphors and symbols, which are the basis
of language itself. A metaphor is a kind of mirror to the concrete and real,
which it often expresses more clearly and deeply than a literal description
does. When you are dealing with the intractable willpower of other people,
direct communication often only heightens their resistance.

This happens most clearly when you complain about people’s behav-
ior, particularly in sensitive areas such as their lovemaking. You will effect
a. far more lasting change if, like Dr. Erickson, you construct an analogy, a
symbolic mirror of the situation, and guide the other through it. As Christ
himself understood, talking in parables is often the best way to teach a les-
son, for it allows people to realize the truth on their own.

When dealing with people who are lost in the reflections of fantasy
worlds (including a host of people who do not live in mental hospitals),
never try to push them into reality by shattering their mirrors. Instead,
enter their world and operate inside it, under their rules, gently guiding
them out of the hall of mirrors they have entered.

Observance VI
The great sixteenth~century Japanese tea master Takeno Sho~o once
passed by a house and noticed a. young man watering flowers near his front
gate. Two things caught Sho—o’s attention——first, the graceful] way the man
performed his task; and, second, the stunningly beautiful rose of Sharon
blossoms that bloomed in the garden. He stopped and introduced himself
to the man, whose name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho—o wanted to stay, but he
had a prior engagement and had to hnny off. Before he left, however,
Rikyu invited him to take tea with him the following morning. Sho-o hap-
pily accepted.

When Sho—o opened the garden gate the next day, he was horrified to
see that not a single flower remained. More than anything else, he had
come to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that he had not had the time to ap
preciate the day before; now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the
gate he stopped himself, and decided to enter Sen no Rikyu’s tea room. Im-
mediately inside, he stopped in his tracks and gazed in astonishment: Be-
fore him a vase hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single rose of
Sharon blossom, the most beautiful in the garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu
had read his guesfs thoughts, and, with this one eloquent gesture, had
demonstrated that this day guest and host would be in perfect harmony.

Sen no Rikyu went on to become the most famous tea. master of all,
and his trademark was this uncanny ability to harmonize himself with his
guests’ thoughts and to think one step ahead, enchanting them by adapting
to their taste.

One day Rjkyu was invited to tea by Yamashina Hechigwan, an ad-

LAW 44

‘

38 -1

z

miter of the tea ceremony but also a man with a vivid sense of humor.
When Rikyu arrived at Hechigwan’s home, he found the garden gate shut,
so he opened it to look for the host. On the other side of the gate he saw
that someone had first dug a ditch, then carefully covered it over with can-
vas and earth. Realizing that Hechigwan had planned a practical joke, he
obligingly walked right into the ditch, muddying his clothes in the process.
Apparently horrified, Hechigwan came running out, and hurried
Rikyu to a bath that for some inexplicable reason stood already prepared.
Afier bathing, Rikyu joined Hechigwan in the tea ceremony, which both
enjoyed immensely, sharing a laugh about the accident. Later Sen no
Rikyu explained to a friend that he had heard about Hechigwan’s practical
joke beforehand, “But since it should always be one’s aim to conform to
the wishes of one’s host, I fell into the hole knowingly and thus assured the
success of the meeting. Tea is by no means mere obsequiousness, but there
is no tea where the host and guest are not in harmony with one another.”
Hechigwan’s vision of the dignified Sen no Rikyu at the bottom of a ditch
had pleased him endlessly, but Rikyu had gained a pleasure of his own
in complying with his host’s wish and watching him amuse himself in
this way.
Interpretation
Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer~—-he watched those around him
acutely, plumbing the subtle gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then
producing that desire’s image. Although Sho—o never spoke of being en-
chanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it in his eyes. If mir-
roring a person’s desires meant falling into a ditch, so be it. Rikyu’s power
resided in his skillful use of the Courtier’s Mirror, which gave him the ap-
pearance of an unusual ability to see into other people.

Learn to manipulate the Courtier’s Mirror, for it will bring you great
power. Study people’s eyes, follow their gestures—-«surer barometers of pain
and pleasure than any spoken word. Notice and remember the details-«the
clothing, the choice of friends, the daily habits, the tossed-out remarks-—
that reveal hidden and rarely indulged desires. Soak it all in, find out what
lies under the surface, then make yourself the mirror of their unspoken
selves. That is the key to this power: The other person has not asked for
your consideration, has not mentioned his pleasure in the rose of Sharon,
and when you reflect it back to him his pleasure is heightened because it is
unasked for. Remember: The wordless communication, the indirect com~
pliment, contains the most power. No one can resist the enchantment of the
Courtier’s Mirror.

Observance Vll
Yellow Kid Weil, con artist extraordinaire, used the Deceiver’s Mirror in
his most brilliant cons. Most audacious of all was his recreation of a bank
in Muncie, Indiana. When Weil read one day that the Merchants Bank in
Muncie had moved, he saw an opportunity he could not pass up.

Well rented out the original Merchants building, which still contained
bank furnitnure, complete with teller windows. He bought money bags,

358

LAW 44

stenciled a bank’s invented name on them, filled them with steel washers,
and arrayed them impressively behind the teller windows, along with bun-
dles of boodlevwreal bills hiding newspaper cut to size. For his banl&lt;’s staff
and customers Weil hired gamblers, bookies, girls from local bawdy
houses, and other assorted confederates. He even had a local thug pose as a
bank dick.

Claiming to be the broker for a certificate investment the bank was of-
fering, Weil would fish the waters and hook the proper wealthy sucker. He
would bring this man to the bank and ask to see the president. An “officer”
of the bank would tell them that they had to wait, which only heightened
the realism of the con-——one always has to wait to see the bank president.
And as they waited the bank would bustle with banklike activity, as call
girls and bookies in disguise floated in and out, making deposits and with»
drawals and tipping their hats to the phony bank dick. Lulled by this per~
feet copy of reality, the sucker would deposit $50,000 into the fake bank
without a worry in the world.

Over the years Weil did the same thing with at deserted yacht club, an
abandoned brokerage office, a relocated real estate office, and a com»
pletely realistic gambling club.
Interpretation
The mirroring of reality offers immense deceptive powers. The right uni»
form, the perfect accent, the proper props——the deception cannot be deci~
phered because it is enmeshed in a simulation of reality. People have an
intense desire and need to believe, and their first instinct is to trust a. well»
constructed facade, to mistake it for reality. After all, we cannot go around
doubting the reality of everything we seewthat would be too exhausting.
We habitually accept appearances, and this is a credulity you can use.

In this particular game it is the first moment that counts the most. If
your suckers’ suspicions are not raised by their first glance at the mirror’s
reflection, they will stay suppressed. Once they enter your hall of mirrors,
they will be unable to distinguish the real from the fake, and it will become
easier and easier to deceive them. Remember: Study the world’s surfaces
and learn to mirror them in your habits, your manner, your clothes. Like a
carnivorous plant, to unsuspecting insects you will look like all the other
plants in the field.

A WARNING: BEWARE OF MIRRORED SITUATIONS
Mirrors contain great power but also dangerous reefs, including the mix»
rored situation--a situation that seems to reflect or closely resemble a pre

such a situation without fully understanding it, while those around you un-

the previous occupant of your position or else tainted by any unpleasant
associations that person has lefi behind.

In 1864 the composer Richard Wagner moved to Munich at the behest
of Ludwig 11, known variously as the Swan King or the Mad King of
Bavaria. Ludwig was Wagner‘s biggest fan and most generous patron. The
strength of his support turned Wagner’s head»-&lt;mce established in Munich
under the king&#x27;s protection, he would be able to say and do whatever he
wanted.

Wagner moved into a lavish house, which the king eventually bought
for him. This house was but a stone’s throw from the former home of Lola
Montez, the notorious courtesan who had plunged Ludwig II’s grandfather
into a crisis that had forced him to abclicate. Warned that he could be in-
fected by this association, Wagner only scoffed-——-“I am no Lola Montez,&quot;
he said. Soon enough, however, the citizens of Munich began to resent the
favors and money showered on Wagner, and dubbed him “the second
Lola,” or “Lolotte.” He unconsciously began to tread in Lo1a’s footsteps-
spending money extravagantly, meddling in matters beyond music, even
dabbling in politics and advising the king on cabinet appointments. Mean-
while Ludwigs affection for Wagner seemed intense and undignified for a
l-:ing——just like his grandfather’s love for Lola Montez.

390

LAW 44

Eventually Ludwig’s ministers wrote him a letter: “Your Majesty now
stands at a fateful parting of the ways: you have to choose between the love
and respect of your faithful people and the ‘friendship’ of Richard Wag-
ner.” In December of 1865, Ludwig politely asked his friend to leave and
never return. Wagner had inadvertently placed himself in Lola Montez’s
reflection. Once there, everything he did reminded the stolicl Bavariams of
that dread woman, and there was nothing he could do about it.

Avoid such association-effects like the plague. In a mirrored situation
you have little or no control over the reflections and recollections that will
be connected to you, and any situation beyond your control is dangerous.
Even if the person or event has positive associations, you will suffer from
not being able to live up to them, since the past generally appears greater
than the present. If you ever notice people associating you with some past
event or person, do everything you can to separate yourself from that
memory and to shatter the reflection.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Sometime in the early 1520s, King Henry VIII of England decided to di-
vorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she had failed to beat him a
son, and because he had fallen in love with the young and comely Anne
Boleyn. The pope, Clement VII, opposed the divorce, and threatened the
king with excommunication. The king’s most powerful minister, Cardinal
Wolsey, also saw no need for divorce—-—-and his halfhearted support of the
king cost him his position and soon his life.

One man in Hem-y’s cabinet, Thomas Cromwell, not only supported
him in his desire for a divorce but had an idea for realizing it: a complete
break with the past. He convinced the king that by severing ties with Rome
and making himself the head of a newly formed English church, he could
divorce Catherine and marry Anne. By I531 Henry saw this as the only so-
lution. To reward Cromwell for his simple but brilliant idea, he elevated
this son of a blacksmith to the post of royal councillor.

By 1534 Cromwell had been named the king’s secretary, and as the
power behind the throne he had become the most powerful man in Eng-
land. But for him the break with Rome went beyondthe satisfaction of the
l&lt;ing‘s carnal desires: He envisioned a new Protestant order in England,
with the power of the Catholic Church smashed and its vast wea.lth in the
hands of the king and the government. In that same year he initiated a
complete survey of the churches and monasteries of England. And as it
turned out, the treasures and moneys that the churches had accumulated
over the centuries were far more than he had imagined; his spies and
agents came back with astonishing figures.

To justify his schemes, Cromwell circulated stories about the corrup-
tion in the English monasteries, their abuse of power, their exploitation of
the people they supposedly served. Having won Parliamenfs support for
breaking up the monasteries, he began to seize their holdings and to put
them out of existence one by one. At the same time, he began to impose
Protestantism, introducing reforms in religious ritual and punishing those
who stuck to Catholicism, and who now were called heretics. Virtually
overnight, England was converted to a new official religion.

A terror fell on the country. Some people had suffered under the
Catholic Church, which before the reforms had been immensely powerful,
but most Britons had strong ties to Catholicism and to its comforting ritu-
als. They watched in horror as churches were demolished, images of the
Madonna and saints were broken in pieces, stainedglass windows were
smashed, and the churches’ treasures were confiscated. With monasteries
that had succored the poor suddenly gone, the poor now flooded the
streets. The growing ranks of the beggar class were further swelled by for
mer monks. On top of all this, Cromwell levied high taxes to pay for his ec«
clesiastical reforms.

In 1535 powerful revolts in the North of England threatened to topple
Henry from his throne. By the following year he had suppressed the rebel-
lions, but he had also begun to see the costs of Cromwell’s reforms. The
king himself had never wanted to go this far-—-he had only wanted a di-

vorce. It was now Cromwell’s turn to watch uneasily as the king began
slowly to undo his reforms, reinstating Catholic sacraments and other ritu-
als that Cromwell had outlawed.

from grace,

Sensing his fall

in 1540 Cromwell decided to regain
Henry’s favor with one throw of the dice: He would End the king a new
wife. Henry’s third wife, Jane Seymour, had died a few years before, and
he had been pining for a new young queen. It was Cromwell who found
him one: Anne of Cleves, a German princess and, most important to
Cromwell, a Protestant. On Crornwell’s commission, the painter Holbein
produced a flattering portrait of Anne; when Henry saw it, he fell in love,
and agreed to marry her. Cromwell seemed back in favor.

Unfortunately, however, Holbein’s painting was highly idealized, and
when the king finally met the princess she did not please him in the least.
His anger against Cromwell—f1rst for the ill~conceived reforms, now for
saddling him with an unattractive and Protestant wife-—could no longer be
contained. In June of that year, Cromwell was arrested, charged as a Protes-
tant extremist and a heretic, and sent to the Tower. Six weeks later, before a
large and enthusiastic crowd, the public executioner cut off his head.

Interpretation
Thomas Cromwell had a simple idea: He would break up the power and
wealth of the Church and lay the foundation for Protestantism in England.
And he would do this in a. mercilessly short time. He knew his speedy re-
forms would cause pain and resentment, but he thought these feelings
would fade in a few years. More important, by identifying himself with
change, he would become the leader of the new order, making the king de
pendent on him. But there was a problem in his strategy: Like a billiard
ball hit too hard against the cushion, his reforms had reactions and caroms
he did not envision and could not control.

The man who initiates strong reforms often becomes the scapegoat for
any kind of dissatisfaction. And eventually the reaction to his reforms may
consume him, for change is upsetting to the human animal, even when it is
for the good. Because the world is and always has been full of insecurity
and threat, we latch on to familiar faces and create habits and rituals to
make the world more comfortable. Change can be pleasant and even
sometimes desirable in the abstract, but too much of it creates an anxiety
that will stir and boil beneath the surface and then eventually erupt.

Never underestimate the hidden conservatism of those around you. It
is powerful and entrenched. Never let the seductive charm of an idea cloud
your reason: just as you cannot make people see the world your way, you
cannot wrench them into the future with painful changes. They will rebel.
If reform is necessary, anticipate the reaction against it and find ways to
disguise the change and sweeten the poison.

OBSERVANCE. OF THE LAW
As a young Communist in the 19203, Mao Tsetung understood better than
any of his colleagues the incredible odds against a Communist victory in

China. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack of military experi-
ence, and small arsenal of weapons, the Party had no hope of success un-
less it won over China’s immense peasant population. But who in the
world was more conservative, more rooted in tradition, than the Chinese
peasantry? The oldest civilization on the planet had a history that would
never loosen its power, no matter how violent the revolution. The ideas of
Confucius remained as alive in the 19203 as they had been in the sixth cen-
tury B.C., when the philosopher was alive, Despite the oppressions of the
current system, would the peasantry ever give up the deep~rooted values of
the past for the great unknown of Communism?

The solution, as Mao saw it, involved a simple deception: Cloak the
revolution in the clothing of the past, making it comforting and legitimate
in people’s eyes. One of Mao’s favorite books was the very popular me
dieval Chinese novel 77:: Water Margin, which recounts the exploits of a
Chinese Robin Hood and his robber band as they struggle against a cor-
rupt and evil monarch. In China in Mao’s time, family ties dominated over
any other kind, for the Confucian hierarchy of father and oldest son re-
mained firmly in place; but The Witter Margin preached a superior value-
the fraternal ties of the band of robbers, the nobility of the cause that unites
people beyond blood. The novel had great emotional resonance for Chi~
nese people, who love to root for the underdog. Time and again, then,
Mao would present his revolutionary army as an extension of the robber
band in The I&#x27;V1terMargz&#x27;n, likening his struggle to the timeless conflict be-
tween the oppressed peasantry and an evil emperor. He made the past
seem to envelop and legitimize the Communist cause; the peasantry could
feel comfortable with and even support a group with such roots in the past.
Even once the Party came to power, Mao continued to associate it with
the past. He presented himself to the masses not as a Chinese Lenin but as
a. modem Chuko Liang, the real»life third-century strategist who figures
prominently in the popular historical novel The Romance of the Wtree King~
dams. Liang was more than a great general—he was a poet, a philosopher,
and a figure of stem moral rectitude. So Mao represented himself as a poet-
wanior like Liang, a man who mixed strategy with philosophy and
preached a new ethics. He made himself appear like a hero from the great
Chinese tradition of warrior statesmen.

Soon, everything in Mao’s speeches and writings had a reference to an
earlier period in Chinese history. He recalled, for example, the great Em-
peror Ch’in, who had unified the country in the third century B.C. Ch’in
had burned the works of Confucius, consolidated and completed the build-
ing of the Great Wall, and given his name to China, Like Ch’in, Mao also
had brought the country together, and had sought bold reforms against an
oppressive past. Ch’in had traditionally been seen as a violent dictator
whose reign was short; the brilliance of Mao’s strategy was to turn this
around, simultaneously reinterpreting Ch’in, justifying his rule in the eyes
of present-day Chinese, and using him to justify the violence of the new
order that Mao himself was creating.

After the failed Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, a power struggle

LAW 45

emerged in the Communist Party in which Mao’s main foe was Lin Piao,
once a close friend of his. To make clear to the masses the difference be-
tween his philosophy and Lin’s, Mao once again exploited the past: He
cast his opponent as representing Confucius, a. philosopher Lin in fact
would constantly quote. And Confucius signified the conservatism of the
past. Mao associated himself, on the other hand, with the ancient philo-
sophical movement known as Legalism, exemplified by the writings of
Han—fei~tzu. The Legalists disdained Confucian ethics; they believed in the
need for violence to create a new order. They worshiped power. To give
himself weight in the struggle, Mao unleashed a nationwide propaganda
campaign against Confucius, using the issues of Confucianism versus Le-
galism to whip the young into a kind of frenzied revolt against the older
generation. This grand context enveloped a. rather banal power struggle,
and Mao once again won over the masses and triumphed over his enemies.

Interpretation
No people had a more profound attachment to the past than the Chinese.
In the face of this enormous obstacle to reform, Mada strategy was simple:
Instead of struggling against the past he turned it to his advantage, associ~
ating his radical Communists with the romantic figures of Chinese history.
Weaving the story of the War of the Three Kingdoms into the struggle be-
tween the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, be cast himself as
Chuko Liang. As the emperors had, he welcomed the cultlike adoration of
the masses, understanding that the Chinese could not function without
some kind of father figure to admire. And after he made a terrible blunder
with the Great Leap Forward, trying to force modernization on the country
and failing miserably, he never repeated his mistake: From then on, radical
change had to be cloaked in the comfortable clothes of the past.

The lesson is simple: The past is powerful. What has happened before
seems greater; habit and history give any act weight. Use this to your ad-
vantage. When you destroy the fa.milia.r you create a void or vacuum; peo
ple fear the chaos that will flood in to fill it. You must avoid stirring up such
fears at all cost. Borrow the weight and legitimacy from the past, however
remote, to create a comforting and familiar presence. This will give your
actions romantic associations, add to your presence, and cloak the nature
of the changes you are attempting.

It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out,
no?‘ more doubtful ofsmcers, run more dangerous to handle,
than to initiate a new order ofthings.

KEYS TO POWER
Human psychology contains many dualities, one of them being that even
while people understand the need for change, knowing how important it is
for institutions and individuals to be occasionally renewed, they are also ir-

396

‘

LAW 45

ritated and upset by changes that affect them personally. They know that
change is necessary, and that novelty provides relief from boredom, but
deep inside they cling to the past. Change in the abstract, or superficial
change, they desire, but a change that upsets core habits and routines is
deeply disturbing to them.

No revolution has gone without a powerful later reaction against it, for
in the long run the void it creates proves too unsettling to the human ani-
mal, who unconsciously associates such voids with death and chaos. The
opportunity for change and renewal seduces people to the side of the revo~
lution, but once their enthusiasm fades, which it will, they are left with a
certain emptiness. Yearning for the past, they create an opening for it to
creep back in.

For Machiavelli, the prophet who preaches and brings change can
only survive by taking up arms: When the masses inevitably yearn for the
past, he must be ready to use force. But the armed prophet. cannot last long
unless he quickly creates a new set of values and rituals to replace the old
ones, and to soothe the anxieties of those who dread change. It is far easier,
and less bloody, to play a kind of con game. Preach change as much as you
like, and even enact your reforms, but give them the comforting appear-
ance of older events and traditions.

Reigning from A.D. 8 to AD. 23, the Chinese emperor Wang Mung
emerged from a period of great historical turbulence in which the people
yearned for order, an order represented for them by Confucius. Some two
hundred years earlier, however, Emperor Ch’in had ordered the writings
of Confucius burned. A few years later, word had spread that certain texts
had miraculously survived, hidden under the scholar’s house. These texts
may not have been genuine, but they gave Wang his opportunity: He first
confiscated them,
then had his scribes insert passages into them that
seemed to support the changes he had been imposing on the country.
When he released the texts, it seemed that Confucius sanctioned Wang’s
reforms, and the people felt comforted and accepted them more easily.

Understand: The fact that the past is dead and buried gives you the
freedom to reinterpret it. To support your cause, tinker with the facts. The
past is a text in which you can safely insert your own lines.

A simple gesture like using an old title, or keeping the same number
for a group, will tie you to the past and support you with the authority of
history. As Machiavelli himself observed, the Romans used this device
when they transformed their monarchy into a republic. They may have in
stalled two consuls in place of the king, but since the king had been served
by twelve lictors, they retained the same number to serve under the con-
suls. The king had personally performed an annual sacrifice, in 9. great
spectacle that stirred the public; the republic retained this practice, only
transferring it to a special “chief of the ceremony, whom they called the
King of the sacrifice.” These and similar gestures satisfied the people and
kept them from clamoring for the monarchy’s return.

Another strategy to disguise change is to make a loud and public dis~
play of support for the values of the past. Seem to be a zealot for tradition

and few will notice how unconventional you really are. Renaissance Flo-
rence had a centuries—old republic, and was suspicious of anyone who
floated its traditions. Cosimo de’ Medici made a Show of enthusiastic sup
port for the republic, while in reality he worked to bring the city under the
control of his wealthy family. In form, the Medicis retained the appearance
of a republic; in substance, they rendered it powerless. They quietly en~
acted a radical change, while appearing to safeguard tradition.
